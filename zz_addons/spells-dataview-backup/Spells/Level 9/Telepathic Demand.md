description: >
  You send the target a message of 25 words or fewer, and it can respond immediately with its own message of 25 words or fewer. Your message is insidious and has the effect of [[Suggestion]], with the message substituting for the spoken suggestion. On a successful save, the target is temporarily immune for 1 day, and on a critical success, the target is temporarily immune for 1 month. You can target a creature only if you have previously been in telepathic contact with it before, such as via the telepathy spell.
