description: >
  You drastically reduce the target's mental faculties. The target must attempt a Will save. The effects of this curse can be removed only through remove curse or another effect that targets curses.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The target is [[Stupefied]] 2 for 1 round.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The target is [[Stupefied]] 4 with an unlimited duration.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target's intellect is permanently reduced below that of an animal, and it treats its Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom modifiers as -5. It loses all class abilities that require mental faculties, including all spellcasting. If the target is a PC, they become an NPC under the GM's control.
