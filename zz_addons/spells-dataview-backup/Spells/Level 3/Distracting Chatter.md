description: >
  You bombard a target with distracting auditory illusions, surrounding them with a tumultuous cacophony of overlapping speech, whispers, screams, and muttering. The target is [[Flat-Footed]], takes a -2 status penalty to purely auditory Perception checks, and must succeed at a DC 5 Flat check to use auditory abilities or verbal spell components. Similarly, a creature who attempts to affect the target with an auditory effect must succeed at a DC 5 Flat check or the attempt fails. The duration depends on the target's Will save.

  &NewLine;**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Success** The duration is 1 round.
  &NewLine;**Failure** The duration is 3 rounds.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The duration is 1 minute.

  &NewLine;**Heightened (7th)** You can target up to five creatures.
