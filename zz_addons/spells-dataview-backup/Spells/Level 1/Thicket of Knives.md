  You create numerous phantom copies of your weapon arm, hiding your true movements and rendering your attacks unpredictable. You gain a +2 status bonus to Deception checks. If you're untrained in Deception, you can use the Feint action anyway, and add your level as your proficiency bonus despite being untrained.
