description: >
  You shout a command that's hard to ignore. You can command the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the [[Fleeing]] condition), release what it's holding, drop [[Prone]], or stand in place. It can't Delay or take any reactions until it has obeyed your command. The effects depend on the target's Will save.
  &NewLine;**Success** The creature is unaffected.
  &NewLine;**Failure** For the first action on its next turn, the creature must use a single action to do as you command.
  &NewLine;**Critical Failure** The target must use all its actions on its next turn to obey your command.
  &NewLine;**Heightened (5th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
