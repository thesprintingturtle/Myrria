**Cast** ►► somatic, verbal
**Range** 100 feet; **Area** all squares that contain plants in a 5-foot burst
**Duration** 1 minute

---
You cause plants in the area to entangle your foes, with the effects of [Entangle](../../Arcane_Tradition/Level%202/Entangle.md). A creature that critically fails the save takes `dice: 2d4|avg` persistent bleed damage in addition to being [Immobilized](../../../Conditions/Immobilized.md). Escaping your bramble doesn't end the bleed damage.

<hr>

**Heightened (+1)** The bleed damage on a critical failure increases by `dice: 1d4|avg`.
