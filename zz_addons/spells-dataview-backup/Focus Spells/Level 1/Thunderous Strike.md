**Cast** â–º verbal; **Requirements** you're wielding a melee weapon in two hands.

---
You swing your massive weapon, creating a wave of sonic vibrations that topples creatures. Make a melee Strike with your two-handed weapon. Each creature in a 15-foot cone from you must attempt a basic Fortitude save against your spell DC or take 2 sonic damage. On a critical failure, the creature is knocked [Prone](../../../Conditions/Prone.md). The target of your Strike must be within the cone or the effect fails.
