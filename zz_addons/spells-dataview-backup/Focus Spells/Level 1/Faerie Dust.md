You sprinkle magical dust in the spell's area, making those within easier to trick. Each creature in the area must attempt a Will save. For each additional action you use Casting the Spell, the burst's radius increases by 5 feet.

**Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Failure** The creature can't use reactions and takes a –2 status penalty to Perception checks and Will saves.
**Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature also takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks and Will saves for 1 minute.
