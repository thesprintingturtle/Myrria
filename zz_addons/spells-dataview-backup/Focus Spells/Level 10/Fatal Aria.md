You perform music so perfect that the target may die of joy or sorrow. Once targeted, the creature becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute. The effect of the spell depends on the target's level and current Hit Points.

**16th or Lower** The target dies instantly.
**17th** If the target has 50 Hit Points or fewer, it dies instantly; otherwise, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes [Dying](../../../Conditions/Dying.md) 1.
**18th or Higher** The target takes 50 damage. If this brings it to 0 Hit Points, it dies instantly.
