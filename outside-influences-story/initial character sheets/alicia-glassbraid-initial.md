	- Their Earth influence manifests as having glass fibers for hair, and their skin turning to solid crystal when they experienced extreme emotions.
	- As a child, their emotional outbusts would send them into a destructive rage that they later could not or could barely remember. In their time at [Faewood](../../myrria/organizations/faewood-academy.md), thye have learned to better control their anger and can crystalize some of their body without blacking out.
	- When they were 7, they injured their father in a rage. This caused him to leave them and their mother, and they have not seen him since.
	- In the following years, they lived with their mother in {lower district of Slipgarten}. They grew to have a major respect for their mother, uncharactericstically so for a child in their early teens.
	- At 14, their mother sent them to the [Faewood Academy](../../myrria/organizations/faewood-academy.md) suddenly one evening, with no buildup or warning. Alicia could tell their mother was distraught, but she offered no explanation why other than that Alicia was dangerous when they still could not control their anger. Alicia has not seen or spoken to her since.
