# Titanfall Handwraps *Item 23*

Originally made by [Ismene Mistbren](../npcs/people/ismene-mistbren-glassbraid.md) as a gift for her partner, [Alicia Glassbraid](../npcs/people/aclicia-glassbraid.md), these white canvas handwraps feature a web of force glyphs, intricately embroidered with purple thread. The web of glyphs becomes visually active when the invested wearer senses imminent combat, with [Spellstrands](../fundamentals/spellstrand.md) appearing in stark white.
