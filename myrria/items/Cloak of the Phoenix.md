# Cloak of the Phoenix *Item 23*

Originally created by [Ismene Mistbren](../characters/people/Ismene%20Mistbren-Glassbraid.md) for her close friend, [Asami Morningfell](../characters/people/Asami%20Morningfell.md), the outside of this cloak is an inky black. The inside layer of this cloak is a deep red with a pattern of light and fire glyphs embroidered in gold. The web of glyphs becomes visually active when the invested wearer senses imminent combat, with [Spellstrands](../terms/Spellstrand.md) appearing in stark white.

## Description
### Appearance

### Properties
**Usage** Worn Cloak; **Bulk** 1
*+4 Major Resilient Major Shadow Explorer's Clothing*
While wearing this cloak, casting *Fly* on yourself lasts 8 hours instead of 1. When the wearer gains the benefits of *Fly*, crimson spectral wings appear from the wearer's back. The [Spellstrands](../terms/Spellstrand.md) from inside the cloak appear mirrored on the wings.
**Activate** Free Action, Interact; **Trigger** You restore hit points using a *Heal* spell; **Effect** You double the number of hit points recovered. Once a creature has been healed using this ability, it becomes immune to it for 1 hour.
**Activate** 10 minutes; **Effect** The cloak casts *Raise Dead* at 10th level. The cloak loses all effects and abilities for a week. If you are actively benefiting from a *Fly* spell that has been in effect for more than 1 hour, the spell ends immediately.
