# Titanfall Handwraps *Item 23*

Originally made by [Ismene Mistbren](../npcs/people/Ismene%20Mistbren-Glassbraid.md) as a gift for her partner, [Alicia Glassbraid](../npcs/people/Aclicia%20Glassbraid.md), these white canvas handwraps feature a web of force glyphs, intricately embroidered with purple thread. The web of glyphs becomes visually active when the invested wearer senses imminent combat, with [Spellstrands](../fundamentals/Spellstrand.md) appearing in stark white.
