# Thousand Yard Stare *Item 23*

One of many unique weapons created by legendary gunslinger [Ismene Mistbren-Glassbraid](../npcs/people/Ismene%20Mistbren-Glassbraid.md), this rifle serves as her primary weapon. It has a long, blackened [mithral](../../_compendium/equipment/items/mithral.md) barrel with a [darkwood](../../_compendium/equipment/items/darkwood.md) stock engraved with a pattern of shadow and force glyphs. The web of glyphs becomes visually active when the invested user senses imminent combat, with [Spellstrands](../fundamentals/spellstrand.md) appearing in stark white.
