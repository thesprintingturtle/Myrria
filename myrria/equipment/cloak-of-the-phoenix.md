# Cloak of the Phoenix *Item 23*  
[arcane](../../_rules/traits/arcane.md) [artifact](../../_rules/traits/artifact-gmg.md) [invested](../../_rules/traits/invested.md) [healing](../../_rules/traits/healing.md) [magical](../../_rules/traits/magical.md) [unique](../../_rules/traits/unique.md) 

- **Usage** worn garment; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** worn

Originally created by [Ismene Mistbren](../npcs/people/ismene-mistbren-glassbraid.md) for her close friend, [Asami Morningfell](../npcs/people/asami-morningfell.md), the outside of this cloak is an inky black. The inside layer of this cloak is a deep red with a pattern of light and fire glyphs embroidered in gold. The web of glyphs becomes visually active when the invested wearer senses imminent combat, with [Spellstrands](../fundamentals/spellstrand.md) appearing in stark white.

This cloak is *+4 major shadow [Explorer's Clothing](../../_compendium/equipment/items/explorers-clothing.md)*. While wearing this cloak, casting *[Fly](../../_rules/actions/fly.md)* on yourself lasts 8 hours instead of 1. When the wearer gains the benefits of *[Fly](../../_rules/actions/fly.md)*, crimson spectral wings appear from the wearer's back. The [Spellstrands](../fundamentals/spellstrand.md) from inside the cloak appear mirrored on the wings.

**Effect** The cloak casts 10th-level *[Raise Dead](../../_compendium/spells/raise-dead.md)*. The cloak loses all effects and abilities for a week. If you are actively benefiting from *[Fly](../../_rules/actions/fly.md)* that has been in effect for over an hour, the spell ends immedeately.
