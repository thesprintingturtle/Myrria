Originally commissioned by [Ismene Mistbren](../npcs/people/ismene-mistbren-glassbraid.md) as a gift for her partner, [Alicia Glassbraid](../npcs/people/aclicia-glassbraid.md), these white canvas handwraps feature a web of force glyphs, intricately embroidered with purple thread from her [Ganzi](../../_rules/traits/ganzi-loag.md) down. The web of glyphs becomes visually active when the invested wearer senses imminent combat, with [Spellstrands](../spellstrand.md) appearing in stark white. The handwraps were created as *+1 striking impactful handwraps of mighty blows*, and gained additional abilities as Ismene and Alicia grew stronger.

These handwraps function as _+4 major striking greater impactful handwraps of mighty blows_. You also gain a +4 item bonus to Athletics checks made to shove or trip. When you invest in these heandwraps, you either increase your Strength by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.

[Interact](../../_rules/actions/interact.md) 
- **Frequency** once per round 
- **Trigger** you successfully land an unarmed melee strike against a creature no more than two size catergories larger than you 

**Effect** You attempt to Shove or Trip the defending creature. On a successful Shove, the creature is pushed up to 20 feet away from you. If this movement is stopped by a wall or object, the creature takes the damage of one of your unarmed melee strikes. On a successful Trip, the target takes half the damage of one of your unarmed melee strikes. You may use this action on creatures who are already prone or against an object.
