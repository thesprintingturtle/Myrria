Originally created by [Ismene Mistbren](../npcs/people/ismene-mistbren-glassbraid.md) as a gift for her partner, [Alicia Glassbraid](../npcs/people/aclicia-glassbraid.md), these white canvas handwraps feature a web of force glyphs, intricately embroidered with purple thread from the down of a [Ganzi](../../_rules/traits/ganzi-loag.md). The web of glyphs becomes visually active when the invested wearer senses imminent combat, with [Spellstrands](../spellstrand.md) appearing in stark white.

These handwraps function as _+4 major striking greater impactful handwraps of mighty blows_. You also gain a +4 item bonus to Athletics checks made to shove or trip. When you invest in these heandwraps, you either increase your Strength by 2 or increase it to 18, whichever is higher.
