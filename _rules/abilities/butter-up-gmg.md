# Butter Up
[emotion](emotion.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

When someone eats a dish or treat made by this NPC, the NPC can attempt a [Baking Lore](../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), [Cooking Lore](../../compendium/skills.md#Lore), or similar check against that creature's Will DC, with the same results as the [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) action of [Diplomacy](../../compendium/skills.md#Diplomacy). If more than one creature partakes, the NPC uses the same check result against each creature's Will DC.
