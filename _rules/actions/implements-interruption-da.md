# Implement's Interruption [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[evocation](evocation.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  
*Source: Dark Archive p. 41*  

- **Trigger** The target of your [Exploit Vulnerability](exploit-vulnerability-da.md) uses a [concentrate](concentrate.md), [manipulate](manipulate.md), or [move](move.md) action, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Requirements**: You're holding your First Implement and Esoterica|Thaumaturge|DA|weapon|DA|1||weapon implement and are benefiting from [Exploit Vulnerability](exploit-vulnerability-da.md) against a creature. The creature must be within your reach if you're wielding a melee weapon, or within 10 feet if you're wielding a ranged weapon.
- **Activity**: Reaction

Your weapon senses a moment of weakness and guides your hand to strike down a foe. Make a [Strike](strike.md) against the triggering creature with your First Implement and Esoterica|Thaumaturge|DA|weapon|DA|1||weapon implement. If your attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the triggering action. This [Strike](strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](strike.md).
