# Attack of Opportunity [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 474*  

**Class** fighter
- **Trigger** A creature within your reach uses a [manipulate](manipulate.md) action or a [move](move.md) action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity**: Reaction

You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a [manipulate](manipulate.md) action, you disrupt that action. This [Strike](strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](strike.md).
