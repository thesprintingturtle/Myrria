**Class** investigator
- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Activity**: Single Action

You assess a foe's weaknesses in combat and use them to formulate a plan of attack against your enemy. Choose a creature you can see and roll a `d20`. If you [Strike](strike.md) the chosen creature later this round, you must use the result of the roll you made to [Devise a Stratagem](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/rules/actions/devise-a-stratagem-apg.md) for your [Strike](strike.md)'s attack roll instead of rolling. You make this substitution only for the first [Strike](strike.md) you make against the creature this round, not any subsequent attacks.

When you make this substitution, you can also add your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, provided your [Strike](strike.md) uses an [agile](agile.md) or [finesse](finesse.md) melee weapon, an [agile](agile.md) or [finesse](finesse.md) unarmed attack, a ranged weapon (which must be [agile](agile.md) or [finesse](finesse.md) if it's a melee weapon with the [thrown](thrown.md) trait), or a [sap](../../compendium/equipment/items/sap.md).

If you're aware that the creature you choose is the subject of a lead you're pursuing, you can use this ability as a free action.
