- **Trigger** Another creature attempts a check to investigate a lead you're pursuing.
- **Activity**: Reaction

You share information with the triggering creature. They gain a circumstance bonus to their check equal to your circumstance bonus to checks investigating your subject from [Pursue a Lead](pursue-a-lead-apg.md). The GM can add any relevant traits to this reaction depending on the situation, such as [auditory](auditory.md) and [linguistic](linguistic.md) if you're conveying information verbally.
