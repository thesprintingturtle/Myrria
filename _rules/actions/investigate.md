# Investigate (basic)
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [exploration](exploration.md)  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 480*  



You seek out information about your surroundings while traveling at half speed. You use [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) as a secret check to discover clues among the various things you can see and engage with as you journey along. You can use any skill that has a [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) action while Investigating, but the GM determines whether the skill is relevant to the clues you could find.
