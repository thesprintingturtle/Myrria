- **Activity**: Free Action

You can [Interact](interact.md) to draw a combination weapon and set it to melee or ranged mode. On your first turn, your movement and ranged attacks don't trigger reactions that are normally triggered by movement or a ranged attack (such as [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md)).
