# Capacity  
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 150*  

Weapons that have the capacity trait typically have multiple barrels or chambers capable of containing a round of ammunition. Capacity is always accompanied by a number indicating the number of barrels or chambers. After a capacity weapon is fired, you can select the next loaded barrel or chamber as an [Interact](interact.md) action that doesn't require a free hand. Each barrel or chamber can be reloaded after it's fired as a separate [Interact](interact.md) action.
