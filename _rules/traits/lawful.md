# Lawful  
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 633*  

Lawful effects often manipulate energy from law-aligned Outer Planes and are antithetical to chaotic divine servants or divine servants of chaotic deities. A creature with this trait is lawful in alignment.

An ability with this trait can be selected or used by lawful creatures only.
