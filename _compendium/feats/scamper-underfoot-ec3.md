# Scamper Underfoot  *Feat 1*  
[shoony](shoony-ec3.md)  


You are used to ducking under foes and can scurry around the battlefield with ease. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Tumble Through](tumble-through.md) the spaces of Medium or larger enemies, and the presence of an enemy doesn't make the squares difficult terrain.
