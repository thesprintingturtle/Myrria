# Change of Face  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Alter Ego Dedication](alter-ego-dedication-da.md)

You know that for the best disguise to work, one requires not only the right skills but also the right lookâ€”luckily you can copy both using special magical techniques. When you [Impersonate](impersonate.md), you don't need a disguise kit; instead, simple illusions or temporary transmutations ripple over your body like mirror shards, providing the supplies that the kit ordinarily would. When you [Impersonate](impersonate.md) in this way, your [Impersonate](impersonate.md) activity gains the [occult](occult.md) trait.
