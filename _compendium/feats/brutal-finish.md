[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](press.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon in two hands.

Your final blow can make an impact even if it rebounds off a foe's defenses. Make a [Strike](strike.md) with the required weapon. After the [Strike](strike.md), your turn ends. The [Strike](strike.md) deals one extra weapon damage die, or two extra weapon damage dice if you're at least 18th level. The [Strike](strike.md) also gains the following failure effect.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Failure** You deal damage equal to one weapon damage die of the required weapon. Increase this to two dice if you're at least 18th level.
