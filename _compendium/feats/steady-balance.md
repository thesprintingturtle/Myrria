# Steady Balance  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics)

You can keep your balance easily, even in adverse conditions. Whenever you roll a success using the [Balance](balance.md) action, you get a critical success instead. You're not [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) while attempting to [Balance](balance.md) on narrow surfaces and uneven ground. Thanks to your incredible balance, you can attempt an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check instead of a Reflex save to [Grab an Edge](grab-an-edge.md).
