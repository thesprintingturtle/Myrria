# Graceful Poise  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [stance](stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Double Slice](double-slice.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

With the right positioning, your off-hand weapon can strike like a scorpion's stinger. While you are in this stance, if you make your second [Strike](strike.md) from Double Slice with an [agile](agile.md) weapon, Double Slice counts as one attack when calculating your multiple attack penalty.
