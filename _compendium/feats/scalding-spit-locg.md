# Scalding Spit  *Feat 9*  
[goblin](goblin.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Torch Goblin](torch-goblin-locg.md)

Your bodily fluids burn with surprising volatility, as if you ran on oil instead of blood. As long as you are taking [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), you gain a boiling spit ranged unarmed attack with a range of 30 feet that deals `1d6` fire damage.
