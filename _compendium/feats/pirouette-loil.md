[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  [rare](rare.md)  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Masquerade of Seasons Stance
- **Trigger** An enemy targets you with a [Strike](strike.md).
- **Requirements**: You're in Masquerade of Seasons Stance.
- **Activity** Reaction

If the attack misses you, you can immediately [Step](step.md). If the attack hits you anyway, reduce the damage it deals by an amount equal to half your level; this reduction in damage is applied after calculating immunities, resistances, and weakness.
