[tengu](tengu-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: wavediver tengu heritage

Your feathers are coated in a waxy substance that repels water. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that have the [water](water.md) trait. So long as you're in a dry place, you can spend one action to shake off any water that clings to your clothing and feathers to instantly become dry.
