# Hammer Quake  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  [open](open.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mauler Dedication](mauler-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a non-[finesse](finesse.md) melee weapon in two hands.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You smash the ground with your weapon, knocking nearby creatures to the ground. Choose a square within your reach, including your own space. If there's a foe in the chosen square, [Strike](strike.md) that foe with the required weapon.

Then attempt to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) every foe in the chosen square plus each square adjacent to that square, ignoring [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md)'s requirement that you have a hand free. This counts as three attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made the [Strike](strike.md), if any, and all the [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) attempts.
