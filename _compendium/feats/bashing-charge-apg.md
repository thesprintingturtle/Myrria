Once during your movement, if your movement passes through or ends adjacent to a door, window, fence, wall, or similar obstacle, you can attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Force Open](force-open.md) the obstacle with a +1 circumstance bonus to the roll; on a failure, your movement ends at that obstacle.
