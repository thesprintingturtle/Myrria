# Dominion Aura  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[aura](rules/traits/aura.md)  [divine](divine.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [force](force.md)  [tiefling](tiefling-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Faultspawn](faultspawn-loil.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

For a short time, you fully manifest the expectations of the god destroyer within you.

All creatures within a 10-foot emanation take `8d6` force damage with a basic Fortitude save. A creature that fails this save is also knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone). For 1 minute, any creature who ends its turn within the 10-foot emanation takes `5d6` force damage with a basic Fortitude save. If you aren't [drained](conditions.md#Drained), you can choose to become [drained](conditions.md#Drained) when you use Dominion Aura to increase the radius of the emanation from 10 feet to 20 feet.
