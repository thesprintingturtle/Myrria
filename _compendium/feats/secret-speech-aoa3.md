# Secret Speech  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)

Choose a secret society (such as the Lacunafex or the Bellflower Network). You've learned that society's secret cant or jargon, enabling you to share condition hidden messages when signing or speaking with others who've also learned it. If an observer succeeds at a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check against your [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) DC when you do this, they realize you are passing a message but fail to discern its content, unless they subsequently succeed at a [Society](../skills.md#Society) check against your [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) DC. On a critical success, they learn not only the message, but also who you're passing the message to.

**Special.** You can take this feat multiple times. You learn the secret speech of a different society each time.
