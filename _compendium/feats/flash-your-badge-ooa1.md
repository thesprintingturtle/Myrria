# Flash Your Badge  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Alkenstar Agent Dedication, master in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a fearsome show of your authority. Roll [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) checks to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) each creature in a 30-foot cone. When you do so, [Demoralize](demoralize.md) gains the [visual](visual.md) trait, and creatures are affected if they can see you. If a target creature hasn't broken a law in the past week (as determined by the GM), the result of your check against that creature is one degree of success worse than the result you rolled.
