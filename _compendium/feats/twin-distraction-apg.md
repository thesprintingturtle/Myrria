# Twin Distraction  *Feat 4*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Twin Feint](twin-feint.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

Your movements with two weapons are so swift and disorienting that they befuddle your opponent. When using [Twin Feint](twin-feint.md), if both your [Strikes](strike.md) deal damage to a targeted creature, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw against your class DC or become [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) until the end of your next turn.
