# Ricochet Stance (Rogue)  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  [stance](stance.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You adopt a [stance](stance.md) to rebound your thrown weapons toward you. While you are in this stance, any thrown weapons you use as part of a ranged [Strike](strike.md) to deal bludgeoning or slashing damage immediately return to your hand, enabling you to use them for additional [Strikes](strike.md). You must be within the weapon's listed range increment and have a hand free to catch the weapon. If you make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) with a thrown weapon outside of its listed range increment, it instead flies back toward you a number of feet equal to its listed range increment and then falls to the ground.
