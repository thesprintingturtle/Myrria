# Bend Space  *Feat 17*  
[kashrishi](kashrishi-loil.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Transcendent Realization

Not even space itself is a match for the unleashed power of your mind. You can cast [teleport](../spells/teleport.md) as an innate occult spell. You don't need to touch creatures to target them with this innate spell as long as they're in range of your empathic sense.
