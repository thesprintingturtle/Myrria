# Draconic Scent  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Disciple Dedication](dragon-disciple-dedication-apg.md)

Your sense of smell is uncanny, much like a dragon's. You gain imprecise [scent](scent.md) with a range of 30 feet. The GM might double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind, at their discretion.
