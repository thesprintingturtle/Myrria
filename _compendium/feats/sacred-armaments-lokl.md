# Sacred Armaments  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md)

Through the power of your faith or the blessing of a priest, your weapons are fully effective against incorporeal creatures.

Weapons you wield have the effects of a [ghost touch](../equipment/items/ghost-touch.md) property rune for as long as you wield them.
