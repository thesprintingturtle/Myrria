All creatures within that area are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed), and all others are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to them. This concealment applies to the triggering effect, and the fog lasts for 1 minute or until dispersed by a strong wind. After resolving the triggering effect, you [Step](step.md). If an effect prevents you from [Stepping](step.md), you attempt to [Escape](escape.md) the effect and [Step](step.md) if you succeed.
