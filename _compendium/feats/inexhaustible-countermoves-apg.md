# Inexhaustible Countermoves  *Feat 20*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  


You can react whenever a foe leaves a gap in their defenses. At the start of each enemy's turn, you gain an extra reaction you can use only during that turn to perform an [Opportune Riposte](opportune-riposte-apg.md), or an Attack of Opportunity if you have that reaction.
