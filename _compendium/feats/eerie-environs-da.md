# Eerie Environs  *Feat 8*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation), trained in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)

The natural world can be scary to those not used to it—and you make it scarier still. If you're [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from a creature, you can attempt to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) it without losing your [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) condition— imitating the sounds of strange beasts or causing the foliage to rustle menacingly. When you do so, you don't take a penalty to your check if the target doesn't understand your language.
