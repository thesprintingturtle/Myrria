# Evanescent Wings  *Feat 1*  
[sprite](sprite-b1.md)  


You've manifested wings that can flutter for brief spurts. You don't need to spend any additional actions to reach something in your space that a Medium creature could reach. For instance, if you wanted to open a cookie jar located four feet off the ground, you only need to spend a single [Interact](interact.md) action to do so. When you use Evanescent Wings to flutter to a higher place in your space, your action gains the [move](move.md) trait.

## Evanescent Wings leads to...

[Energize Wings](energize-wings-loag.md), [Hero's Wings](heros-wings-loag.md)
