# Agile Hand  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [mage hand](../spells/mage-hand.md)

When you cast [mage hand](../spells/mage-hand.md), you can modify its target to be a set of thieves' tools. When you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md) in this way, the tools move up to 20 feet towards a device or lock. After you [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md) on future turns, you can use the tools to attempt [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) checks to [Disable a Device](disable-a-device.md) or [Pick a Lock](pick-a-lock.md) within the spell's range, but you take a â€“2 penalty to your [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check. If you critically fail, the spell ends and you can't use this modification again for 24 hours.
