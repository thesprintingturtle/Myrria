# Crystalline Cloud  *Feat 9*  
[aphorite](aphorite-loag.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Crystalline Dust](crystalline-dust-loag.md)

When you use Crystalline Dust, you can spend one additional action to disperse the motes as a 10-foot-radius cloud centered on you instead of as haze; the activity gains the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait. All creatures within the cloud become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed), and all creatures outside the cloud become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it.
