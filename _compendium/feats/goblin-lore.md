# Goblin Lore  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](goblin.md)  


You've picked up skills and tales from your goblin community. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) and [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Goblin Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
