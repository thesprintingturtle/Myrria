# Dubious Knowledge  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in a skill with the [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) action

You're a treasure trove of information, but not all of it comes from reputable sources. When you fail (but don't critically fail) a [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) check using any skill, you learn a bit of true knowledge and a bit of erroneous knowledge, but you don't have any way to differentiate which is which.
