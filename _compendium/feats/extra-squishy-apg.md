# Extra Squishy  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](goblin.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: unbreakable goblin heritage

Your rubbery physique makes it easier for you to wedge yourself into tight spaces and more difficult for your enemies to dislodge you. You become trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics). If you would automatically become trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. If you roll a success to [Squeeze](squeeze.md), you get a critical success instead. While you're [Squeezing](squeeze.md), you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to your Fortitude or Reflex DCs against attempts to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) you or otherwise move you from your space.
