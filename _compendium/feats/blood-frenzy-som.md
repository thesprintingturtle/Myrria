# Blood Frenzy  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[eidolon](eidolon-som.md)  [evolution](evolution-som.md)  [summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bloodletting Claws](bloodletting-claws-som.md)
- **Requirements**: Your eidolon's last action dealt bleed damage to a living creature.
- **Activity** Single Action

Your eidolon flies into a frenzy. It gains the benefits of [boost eidolon](../spells/boost-eidolon-som.md) and gains temporary HP equal to your level, but takes a â€“2 penalty to AC. It can't voluntarily end the frenzy or start another frenzy while in the frenzy. The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which your eidolon is [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) for 1 minute and can't start another frenzy for 1 minute.
