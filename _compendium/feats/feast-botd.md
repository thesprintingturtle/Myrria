# Feast  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [manipulate](manipulate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Zombie Dedication](zombie-dedication-botd.md)
- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to a [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) or [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You feast upon an adjacent [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) or [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) creature, or a deceased creature that died in the past hour. If the creature is alive, you deal damage equal to your jaws damage. Whether it's alive or not, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your level that last for 1 minute.

You can instead choose to gain temporary Hit Points equal to double your level, but if you do, you must succeed at a DC 6 flat check or your body deteriorates.
