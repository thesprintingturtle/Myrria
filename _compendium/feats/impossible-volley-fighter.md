# Impossible Volley (Fighter)  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  [open](open.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon with the [volley](volley.md) trait and [reload 0](reload.md).
- **Activity** Three-Action

You fire a volley at all foes in an area. Make one [Strike](strike.md) with a â€“2 penalty against each enemy within a 10-foot-radius burst centered at or beyond your weapon's volley range. Roll the damage only once for all targets.

Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but do not increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
