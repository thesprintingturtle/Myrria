# Counterspell (Sorcerer)  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature casts a spell that you have in your repertoire.
- **Requirements**: You have an unexpended spell slot you could use to cast the triggering spell.
- **Activity** Reaction

When a foe [Casts a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) you know and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own magic to counter it.

You expend one of your spell slots to counter the triggering creature's casting of a spell that you have in your repertoire. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell.

**Special.** This feat has the trait corresponding to the tradition of spells you cast ([arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), natural, or [occult](occult.md)).
