# Conceited Mindset  *Feat 2*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil

Because you know your mind is superior, you scoff at anyone who would alter your mental stateâ€”but this hubris gets the better of you when you're wrong. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against [mental](mental.md) effects. If you succeed at a save against a [mental](mental.md) effect, you critically succeed instead; similarly, if you fail at a save against a [mental](mental.md) effect, you critically fail instead.
