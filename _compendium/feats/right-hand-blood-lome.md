# Right-hand Blood  *Feat 5*  
[gnoll](gnoll-b1.md)  


It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that of the left side is poisonous. You can take 1 damage to feed someone blood from your right side and [Administer First Aid](administer-first-aid.md) or take `2d8` damage to [Treat Disease](treat-disease.md) or [Treat Wounds](treat-wounds.md); in either case, you don't need healer's tools, and gain a +1 item bonus. Blood from your left side causes the check to critically fail automatically.
