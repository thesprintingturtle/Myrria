# Never Tire  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Celebrity Dedication](celebrity-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** You would gain the [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) condition.
- **Requirements**: You are [observed](conditions.md#Observed) by at least three creatures who aren't foes.
- **Activity** Reaction

As long as you have an audience, you can continue to perform. Indeed, you mustâ€”you have an obligation to your fans! You delay the effects of the [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) condition for 1 minute or until you are no longer [observed](conditions.md#Observed) by the required creatures, whichever comes first. If the [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) condition has a duration, the duration begins to elapse only after the delay. You can't further delay or prevent the [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) condition after this ability ends.
