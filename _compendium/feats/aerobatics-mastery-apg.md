# Aerobatics Mastery  *Feat 7*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics)

You move with grace in flight and can perform amazing aerial stunts. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks to [Maneuver in Flight](maneuver-in-flight.md) and can combine two maneuvers into a single action, such as reversing direction while making a steep ascent or descent or hovering in gale-force winds. The DC of the [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 5. If you're legendary in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), you can combine three such maneuvers into a single action; the DC of the [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check is equal to the DC of the most difficult maneuver + 10. Regardless of the combination, these maneuvers rarely allow you to move farther than your fly Speed.
