[arcane](arcane.md)  [automaton](automaton-g-g.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You redirect energy from your core to ports on your back or feet, allowing you to fly for a short time. You can maintain this redirected energy for 5 minutes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed while redirecting the energy.

**Enhancement** You can maintain your flight for longer. You can redirect your energy at all times, allowing you to fly whenever you want, rather than just once per day for 5 minutes.
