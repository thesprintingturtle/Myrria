[kitsune](kitsune-loag.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Kitsune Spell Mysteries](kitsune-spell-mysteries-loag.md)

Your tails show your magical mastery. During your daily preparations, choose [confusion](../spells/confusion.md), [death ward](../spells/death-ward.md), or [illusory scene](../spells/illusory-scene.md). You can [Cast this Spell](cast-a-spell.md) as a 5th-level divine innate spell once that day. You become an expert in divine spell DCs and divine spell attack rolls.
