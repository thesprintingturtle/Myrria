# Keep Pace  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Trigger** Your prey is within reach and attempts to move away from you.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your prey can't escape. [Stride](stride.md) up to your Speed, following the foe and keeping it in reach throughout its movement until it stops moving or you've moved your full Speed. You can use Keep Pace to [Burrow](burrow.md), [Climb](climb.md), [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](swim.md) instead of [Stride](stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
