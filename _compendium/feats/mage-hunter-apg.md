[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: superstition instinct
- **Trigger** A creature within your reach Casts a Spell.
- **Activity** Reaction

You use your hatred of magic to lash out at the sight of spellcasting, allowing you to interrupt an enemy's spell. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the spell.
