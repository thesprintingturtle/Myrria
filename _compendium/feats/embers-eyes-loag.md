# Ember's Eyes  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](ifrit-b2.md)  


Your eyes blaze with inner flame. You gain [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md), or you gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) if your ancestry already has [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md).

**Special.** If your ancestry has neither [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md) nor [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md), you can take this ancestry feat a second time to gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md). You can't retrain out of this feat.
