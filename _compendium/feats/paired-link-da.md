# Paired Link  *Feat 4*

You break a trinket such as a lodestone or jade pendant in two, creating a sympathetic link between the halves that bridges distance. During your daily preparations, you perform a short ceremony where you gift one of the two halves to a willing ally.

On that ally, you can cast spells and use thaumaturge abilities that have a range of touch at a range of 30 feet instead, and the ally can cast spells that have a range of touch on you from a range of 30 feet. These effects last as long as you and the ally have their half; if either half leaves either of your possession for even a moment, or if you establish a link with a new ally during your next daily preparations, the link breaks.
