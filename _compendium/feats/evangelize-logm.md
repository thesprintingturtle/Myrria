# Evangelize  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 7*  
[auditory](auditory.md)  [general](general.md)  [linguistic](linguistic.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy), you follow a deity or philosophy
- **Activity** Single Action

You point out a detail that incontrovertibly supports your faith, causing a listener's mind to whirl. Attempt a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check and compare the result to the Will DC of a single target that can hear you and understands your language; that target is then temporarily immune to Evangelize with respect to your deity or philosophy for 1 day. A creature that already agrees with you is unaffected, and at the GM's discretion, a target that genuinely changes its perspective to support your faith as a result of the argument is also otherwise unaffected.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round.
> - **Success** The target is [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target is unaffected.
