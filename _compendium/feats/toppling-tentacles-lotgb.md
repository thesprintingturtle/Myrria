# Toppling Tentacles  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [black tentacles](../spells/black-tentacles.md)

When you cast [black tentacles](../spells/black-tentacles.md), replace the spell's standard effects with the following: Tentacles slither along the ground in the area, attempting to hinder anyone within. Sticky black tentacles attempt to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) each creature in the area. Attempt spell attack rolls against the Reflex DCs of each affected creature. Any creature you succeed against is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone) and takes `3d6` bludgeoning damage. Whenever a creature ends its turn in the area, the tentacles attempt to [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md) that creature if it isn't already [prone](conditions.md#Prone), and they deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage to any creature already [prone](conditions.md#Prone). Creatures treat the spell's area as difficult terrain.
