# Sculpt Shadows  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 9*  
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  [fetchling](fetchling-b2.md)  [occult](occult.md)  [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md)  

- **Activity** Three-Action

You coax nearby shadows into the shape of a simple weapon or a simple tool or item, using a tiny piece of your shadow to make it solid; in doing so, you lose 1 Hit Point. You can create only level-0 common, non-consumable weapons, or adventuring gear with no intricate parts, written text, or other complicated components.

The item lasts until used for a single activity, until you Sculpt Shadows again, or for 1 minute, whichever comes first. Once the duration expires, the object dissipates, and you regain the lost Hit Point unless the item was [Broken](conditions.md#Broken) or Destroyed. As the object holds a tiny sliver of your shadow, you can't recover the lost Hit Point until after the object dissipates.
