# Vishkanya Lore  *Feat 1*  
[vishkanya](vishkanya-loil.md)  


You deeply understand vishkanyan strengths and cultural traditions. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) and [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Vishkanya Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
