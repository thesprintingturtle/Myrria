# Discerning Strike  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md), [Thorough Reports](thorough-reports-lowg.md)
- **Requirements**: You have successfully identified the target with [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) during this combat.
- **Activity** Single Action

Identifying a creature is the first step in finding its weaknesses.

Attempt a [Strike](strike.md) against the target; if successful, you deal an additional `1d6` precision damage. If you have succeeded on a [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) check against the target during this combat and their creature type was previously recorded using [Thorough Reports](thorough-reports-lowg.md), you also deal 1 point of [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The creature is then temporarily immune to Discerning Strike for 1 day.
