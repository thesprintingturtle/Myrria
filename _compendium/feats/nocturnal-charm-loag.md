# Nocturnal Charm  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](dhampir-b1.md)  


The supernatural charm of your vampiric progenitor hangs about you, and you've learned to use it on mortals. Against humanoids (or other creatures of your type, if you're not a humanoid), you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](lie.md), and to [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) checks to [Gather Information](gather-information.md) and [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md).
