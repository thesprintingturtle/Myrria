# Read Disaster  *Feat 8*  
[divination](divination.md)  [exploration](exploration.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [prediction](prediction.md)  


You spend 10 minutes and open yourself to the divine mysteries of the world, peering into the most sinister portents of the future. You gain the effects of [augury](../spells/augury.md), except you learn only about the dangers ahead; any results of "weal" are instead "nothing," and results of "weal and woe" are instead "woe." If you are legendary in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion), you take only 1 minute to Read Disaster.
