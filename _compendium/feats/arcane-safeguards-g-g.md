# Arcane Safeguards  *Feat 5*  
[automaton](automaton-g-g.md)  

- **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a harmful [magical](magical.md) effect but haven't rolled yet.

Your innate magic protects you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the triggering saving throw. Additionally, if the triggering effect is arcane, if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead.
