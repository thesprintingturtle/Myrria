# Discreet Inquiry  *Feat 2*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) or [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)

You are subtle in your efforts to learn the things you need to know. When [Gathering Information](gather-information.md), you can hide the true subject of your inquiry among other topics of little interest to you without increasing the difficulty of the check or taking more time to [Gather Information](gather-information.md). Anyone trying to [Gather Information](gather-information.md) to determine if someone else was asking around about the topic in question must exceed your [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) DC or the normal DC to [Gather Information](gather-information.md) about your inquiries, whichever is higher, or else they don't learn of your efforts.
