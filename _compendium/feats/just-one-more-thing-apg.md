# Just One More Thing  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[fortune](fortune.md)  [investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  

- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to [Feint](feint.md), [Request](request.md), or [Demoralize](demoralize.md), and you failed but didn't critically fail.
- **Activity** Single Action

After your attempt to influence someone goes poorly, you add another bit of information or ask a pointed question, possibly salvaging your previous attempt. Reroll the failed check and use the new result. If the target of the failed check is the subject of a lead you're pursuing, double your bonus from [Pursue a Lead](pursue-a-lead-apg.md) on the rerolled check. That creature is temporarily immune to Just One More Thing for 1 day.

You can also use this action if you failed, but didn't critically fail, at a check to [Lie](lie.md), [Gather Information](gather-information.md), [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md), or [Coerce](coerce.md). In this case, rather than spending 1 action, adding Just One More Thing takes you half the amount of time you initially spent on the check, to a minimum of 1 more round.
