# Spell Shroud  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Your spell shrouds you in a billowing cloud. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) that targets you, you surround yourself in a 15-foot emanation of dense magical mist that lasts until the start of your next turn. All creatures within the cloud become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed), and all creatures outside the cloud are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it.
