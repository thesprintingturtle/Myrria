# Engine Of Destruction  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*  
[inventor](rules/traits/inventor-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: construct innovation
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your construct unleashes a broad swath of devastation by separating its limbs, deploying hidden armaments, or using a similar technique to wreak havoc. You Command your innovation. Instead of its normal actions, it [Strides](stride.md) once, then makes a [Strike](strike.md) against each foe within 30 feet of it with a +2 circumstance bonus to its attack rolls. The multiple attack penalty doesn't increase until after the construct makes all the attacks.
