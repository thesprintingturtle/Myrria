# Tweak Appearances  *Feat 2*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

You spend 1 minute making quick adjustments to someone's clothing and appearance, causing their words to carry more weight with an audience of your choice.

While speaking to that audience, the target gains a +1 item bonus to [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) checks. If you have master proficiency in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), the bonus increases to +2; if you have legendary proficiency in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), the bonus increases to +3. This bonus lasts until this ability is used on the target again, the situation they were prepared for ends, or they next change their outfit.
