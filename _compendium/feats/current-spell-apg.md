# Current Spell  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

As you use your magic to manipulate air or water, you divert some of its currents to form a barrier around you. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) with the [air](air.md) or [water](water.md) trait, until the start of your next turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC or a +2 circumstance bonus against ranged attacks. This effect has the [air](air.md) or [water](water.md) trait, or both, depending on the traits of the spell you cast. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saves against effects with the [air](air.md) trait, [water](water.md) trait, or both until the start of your next turn, depending on the spell's traits.
