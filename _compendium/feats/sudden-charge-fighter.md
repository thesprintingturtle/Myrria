# Sudden Charge (Fighter)  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 1*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  [open](open.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. [Stride](stride.md) twice. If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against that enemy. You can use Sudden Charge while [Burrowing](burrow.md), [Climbing](climb.md), [Flying](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swimming](swim.md) instead of [Striding](stride.md) if you have the corresponding movement type.
