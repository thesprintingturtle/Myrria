# Lifesense  *Feat 5*  
[divination](divination.md)  [divine](divine.md)  [duskwalker](duskwalker-apg.md)  


You have a limited ability to sense life force, like your psychopomp forebears. You gain [lifesense](lifesense.md) as an imprecise sense with a range of 10 feet. This allows you to sense the life force within living creatures and its counterforce that animates the undead, though you can't distinguish between the two.
