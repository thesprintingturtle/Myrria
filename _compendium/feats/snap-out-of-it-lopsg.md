- **Prerequisites**: master in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine), [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

Pathfinders are trained to help each other be safe and successful, and you know how to jolt your allies back to their senses. Attempt a [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) check on an adjacent ally who is [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated), [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened), [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned), or [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) and choose one of those conditions. The DC is the DC for the effect that caused the condition.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 2. If you chose [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated), that condition ends.
> - **Success** Reduce the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated), that condition ends.
> - **Failure** The target is unaffected.
> - **Critical Failure** You increase the value of the chosen condition by 1. If you chose [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated), increase the duration by 1 round instead.
