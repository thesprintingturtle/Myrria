# Extinguish Light  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [fetchling](fetchling-b2.md)  [occult](occult.md)  

- **Frequency**: once every 10 minutes
- **Activity** Two-Action

You wrap shadow around a single unattended light source within 120 feet that's no larger than a torch. Any non-magical light source you target is automatically extinguished. For magical light sources, attempt a counteract check using your Fortitude or [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) modifier against the target's DC. Your counteract level is equal to half your level rounded up. Successfully counteracting the light source suppresses its ability to produce light for 1 minute, but not any other effects. If you're in dim light or darkness when you Extinguish Light, its range is 240 feet.
