# Pirate Weapon Training  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pirate Dedication](pirate-dedication-apg.md)

You're particularly skilled at wielding traditional pirate weapons. You become trained with the following weapons: [hatchet](../equipment/items/hatchet.md), [rapier](../equipment/items/rapier.md), [scimitar](../equipment/items/scimitar.md), and [whip](../equipment/items/whip.md). Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency with a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency rank for these weapons.
