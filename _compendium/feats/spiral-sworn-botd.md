# Spiral Sworn  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [divine](divine.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Soul Warden Dedication](soul-warden-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Activity** Single Action

You trace a spiral in the air while intoning prayers to [Pharasma](../setting/deities/pharasma.md), gaining her blessing for a time. For 3 rounds, your [Strikes](strike.md) and spells deal additional damage against undead, creatures in possession of an imprisoned soul, or creatures you have witnessed create or command undead. You gain a status bonus to damage with your [Strikes](strike.md) against these creatures equal to the number of weapon damage dice. Spells you cast from spell slots gain a status bonus to damage against these creatures equal to the level of the spell; this bonus applies only to spells that deal damage and don't have a duration.

If your spiral is glowing, you can target a willing creature in its light. If you do, that creature gains the bonuses instead of you.
