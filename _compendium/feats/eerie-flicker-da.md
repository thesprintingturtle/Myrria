# Eerie Flicker  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 2*  
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  [deviant](deviant-da.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [rare](rare.md)  

- **Trigger** A enemy's [Strike](strike.md) would hit you and you weren't already [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed), [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden), or [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) by that enemy.
- **Activity** Reaction

Your body flickers momentarily into the Ethereal Plane. You become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) for 1 round, and the flat check for concealment applies to the [Strike](strike.md) that would have hit you. If the flat check fails, the [Strike](strike.md) misses you.

**Awakening** When your body flickers, you momentarily assume a terrifying form. If a creature fails the flat check against concealment from your Eerie Flicker, it becomes [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened), and it doesn't reduce the [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition from this effect at the end of the same turn it gained the condition.

**Awakening** You can choose to compress your flickering movement into a single moment, increasing your chance to avoid the triggering attack in exchange for a shorter-lived effect. If you choose to do so, the flat check for concealment against the triggering attack increases to DC 9, but the concealment affects only the triggering [Strike](strike.md).
