# Storyteller's Mask  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  [rare](rare.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask remembers the stories of Shifting Frog, Storyteller of the Past and Future. You can cast [foresight](../spells/foresight.md) once per day as an innate spell, either arcane if you have Wizard Dedication or primal if you have Druid Dedication, but the duration is 10 minutes instead of 1 hour.

Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only a single foe, you can [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) about that foe.
