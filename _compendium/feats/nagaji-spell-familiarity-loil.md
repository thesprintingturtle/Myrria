# Nagaji Spell Familiarity  *Feat 1*  
[nagaji](nagaji-loil.md)  


Either through study, exposure, or familial devotion, you have the magic of nagas bubbling in your blood. During your daily preparations, choose [daze](../spells/daze.md), [detect magic](../spells/detect-magic.md), or [mage hand](../spells/mage-hand.md). Until your next daily preparations, you can cast the chosen spell as an occult innate cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.
