# Share Weakness  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[esoterica](esoterica-da.md)  [manipulate](manipulate.md)  [thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Exploit Vulnerability](exploit-vulnerability-da.md), mortal weakness
- **Requirements**: You are Exploiting a creature's Vulnerability using mortal weakness.
- **Activity** Single Action

You select an object from your esoterica that has great personal value to you, such as a locket or treasured ring, and you grant it to an ally, establishing a personal link that allows your ally to affect an enemy as if they were you. The ally's [Strikes](strike.md) apply the weakness from your mortal weakness the same way your [Strikes](strike.md) do. This benefit ends when your [Exploit Vulnerability](exploit-vulnerability-da.md) ends or you Share Weakness again.
