# Surging Might  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[manipulate](manipulate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

With a complex gesture, you focus the divine power of your spell to overcome enemies' resistances. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md), the spell ignores an amount of the target's resistance equal to your level against all the following types of damage: chaotic, evil, good, lawful, negative, and positive. This applies to all damage the spell deals, including [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and damage caused by an ongoing effect of the spell, such as the positive energy within a field of life. This doesn't cause the spell to ignore immunities, only resistances.
