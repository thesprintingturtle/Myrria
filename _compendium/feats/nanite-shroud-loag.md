# Nanite Shroud  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[android](android-loag.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your nanites fly out of your body, swarming around you in a cloud. You become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) for a number of rounds equal to half your level. You can't use this concealment to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](sneak.md), as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious. While Nanite Shroud is active, you can't use other abilities that require the use of your nanites.
