You are skilled at learning information through conversation. The [Gather Information](gather-information.md) exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). If you're a master in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) and you [Gather Information](gather-information.md) at the normal speed, when you attempt to do so and roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with [Gather Information](gather-information.md) is accurate.

## Hobnobber leads to...

[Entourage](entourage-locg.md)
