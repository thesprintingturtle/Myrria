# Kitsune Lore  *Feat 1*  
[kitsune](kitsune-loag.md)  


You excel at navigating social situations and keeping secrets. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Deception](../skills.md#Deception). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Kitsune Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
