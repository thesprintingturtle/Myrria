# Counterspell (Wizard)  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [arcane](arcane.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature [Casts a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) that you have prepared.
- **Activity** Reaction

When a foe [Casts a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) and you can see its manifestations, you can use your own magic to counter it.

You expend a prepared spell to counter the triggering creature's casting of that same spell. You lose your spell slot as if you had cast the triggering spell. You then attempt to counteract the triggering spell.

## Counterspell (Wizard) leads to...

[Clever Counterspell](clever-counterspell.md), [Reflect Spell (Wizard)](reflect-spell-wizard.md)
