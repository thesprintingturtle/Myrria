# Defiance Unto Death  *Feat 5*  
[elf](elf.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Spiresworn elf

You loathe the alghollthus and their mind magic, and you've been trained to be willing to die rather than give into mental manipulation. If you would start your turn [confused](conditions.md#Confused), [controlled](conditions.md#Controlled), or [fleeing](conditions.md#Fleeing) due to a failed Will save, you can attempt a Will save against the same DC; on a success, you become [paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed) until your next turn, rather than act against your will.
