# Tools Of The Trade  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  


You're well-versed in weapons that allow you to bring bounties in alive. You are trained with the following weapons: [bola](../equipment/items/bola-apg.md), [sap](../equipment/items/sap.md), and [whip](../equipment/items/whip.md). You gain access to [bolas](../equipment/items/bola-apg.md). Whenever you gain a class feature that grants you expert or greater proficiency in a given weapon or weapons, you also gain that proficiency in the weapons listed.

In addition, you take no penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon without the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md) trait.
