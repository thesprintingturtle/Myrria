# Walk The Plank  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pirate Dedication](pirate-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You frighten a foe into moving where you want them, traditionally demanding they walk the plank. Attempt to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) an opponent; this check gains the [incapacitation](incapacitation.md) trait. On a success, in addition to the normal effects, you can also force the target to [Stride](stride.md) up to its Speed. You choose the path the target takes, and it does so as part of your Walk the Plank action. You can't force the target to move into a harmful space (one where it will take damage, fall, provoke reactions, or similar) unless the result of your check to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) was a critical success. The target then becomes temporarily immune to Walk the Plank for 24 hours.
