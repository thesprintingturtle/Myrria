[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon and your target is within your reach.
- **Activity** Two-Action

With punishing blows, you force your opponent into position. Make a [Strike](strike.md) with the required weapon. If you hit, you move the target 5 feet into a space in your reach. This follows the forced movement rules found on page 475.
