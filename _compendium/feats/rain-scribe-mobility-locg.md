# Rain-scribe Mobility  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Rain-Scribes affiliation
- **Activity** Two-Action

You surround yourself in a mantle of Rain-Scribe magic and [Stride](stride.md) twice; difficult terrain does not reduce your Speed, even if the difficult terrain has been manipulated by magic. Your magic clears the difficult terrain in each square you entered; until your next turn, those squares aren't difficult terrain for any creature walking through them (or are normal difficult terrain if they were previously greater difficult terrain).
