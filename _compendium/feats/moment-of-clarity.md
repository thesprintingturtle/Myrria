[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You push back your rage for a moment in order to think clearly. Until the end of this turn, you can use actions with the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait even if those actions don't have the [rage](rules/traits/rage.md) trait.
