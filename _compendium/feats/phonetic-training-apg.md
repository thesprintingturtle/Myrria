# Phonetic Training  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Linguist Dedication](linguist-dedication-apg.md), expert in [Society](../skills.md#Society)

You can pronounce and repeat words with near-perfect accuracy even if you don't understand their meaning, and you can write them down in a phonetic script that allows you or another creature with Phonetic Training to read it later. Even if the words are in a language with sound you can't pronounce, you can faithfully transcribe them.

Memorizing long sequences of words remains just as difficult as it is normally.
