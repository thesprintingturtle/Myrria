# Remote Trigger  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Snarecrafter Dedication](snarecrafter-dedication-apg.md)

You've learned how to trigger snares from afar, creating ranged hazards to assail your opponents and allowing you to disarm enemies' snares harmlessly. You can [Strike](strike.md) a snare to trigger it prematurely. If you crafted the snare, you automatically hit. If someone else crafted it, attempt a ranged [Strike](strike.md) against the [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) DC, triggering the snare only if you hit.
