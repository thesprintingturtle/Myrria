# Guide the Timeline  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Chronoskimmer Dedication](chronoskimmer-dedication-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You know the result you want and subtly nudge the timeline to your intended destination. Choose an ally or a foe. If you choose an ally, the next time within the next round that ally makes an attack roll or skill check, they roll it twice and take the higher result; this is a [fortune](fortune.md) effect. If you choose a foe, the next time within the next round that foe makes an attack roll or skill check, they must roll twice and take the lower result unless they succeed at a Will save against your chronoskimmer DC; this is a [misfortune](misfortune.md) effect. Regardless of your choice, the target becomes temporarily immune for 24 hours.
