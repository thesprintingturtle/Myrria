# Breath of Calamity  *Feat 17*  
[nagaji](nagaji-loil.md)  


Your roar shakes the earth and splits the heavens. Once per day, you can cast [chain lightning](../spells/chain-lightning.md) as a 7th-level innate occult spell.

Any creature that critically fails its save against the spell is [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) and [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 round.
