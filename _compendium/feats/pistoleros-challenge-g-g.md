# Pistolero's Challenge  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[auditory](auditory.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  [linguistic](linguistic.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the pistolero
- **Activity** Single Action

With a stern call, carefully chosen barb, or some other challenging declaration, you demand your foe's attention in a duel. Choose an opponent within 30 feet who you can perceive and can hear you, and make your choice of a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) or [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check against the target's Will DC. No matter the result of the check, the foe is temporarily immune to your Pistolero's Challenge until noon the next day.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** Both you and the opponent gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with [Strikes](strike.md) made against each other. If you're a master in the skill you used for the check, the status bonus to damage rolls increases to +3, and if you're legendary, it increases to +4. You can have only one challenge in effect at a time; challenging a new opponent ends this effect on any current target. Otherwise, the effect lasts until one of you is defeated, flees, or the encounter ends.
> - **Critical Failure** You become [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) and can't use this ability again for 1 minute.
