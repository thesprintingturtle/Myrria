# Blind-fight (Investigator)  *Feat 8*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Perception](../skills.md#Perception)

Your battle insights make you more aware of [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) and [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) opponents. You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) creatures. You're not [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to creatures that are [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from you (unless you're [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to them for reasons other than the [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) condition), and you need only a successful DC 5 flat check to target a [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) creature.

While you're adjacent to an [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) creature of your level or lower, it is instead only [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from you.
