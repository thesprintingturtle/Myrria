# Quickened Casting (Wizard)  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 10*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Free Action

In a mentally strenuous process, you modify your casting of a spell to take less time. If your next action is to cast a wizard cantrip or a wizard spell that is at least 2 levels lower than the highest level wizard spell you can cast, reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action).
