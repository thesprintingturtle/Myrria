# Revivification Protocol  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 13*  
[android](android-loag.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You have the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition and are about to attempt a recovery check.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your nanites are programmed to automatically revive you. You're restored to 1 Hit Point, lose the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) and [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) conditions, and can act normally on this turn. You gain or increase the [wounded](conditions.md#Wounded) condition as normal when losing the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition in this way.
