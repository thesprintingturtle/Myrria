# Illusion Sense  *Feat 1*  
[gnome](gnome.md)  


Your ancestors spent their days cloaked and cradled in illusions, and as a result, sensing illusion magic is second nature to you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to both [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks and Will saves against illusions. When you come within 10 feet of an illusion that can be 0, the GM rolls a secret check for you to 0, even if you didn't spend an action to [Interact](interact.md) with the illusion.

## Illusion Sense leads to...

[Intuitive Illusions](intuitive-illusions-locg.md), [Natural Illusionist](natural-illusionist-locg.md)
