# Criminal Connections  *Feat 2*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Society](../skills.md#Society), [Streetwise](streetwise.md)

You have dealings with a variety of unsavory characters, which you can leverage to trade favors or meet powerful people. When you're in an area where you have connections (typically a settlement where you've spent downtime building connections or possibly another area in the same nation), you can attempt a [Society](../skills.md#Society) check to arrange a meeting with an important criminal, such as a thieves' guild leader, or ask for a favor in exchange for a later favor of your contact's choice.

The GM decides the DC based on the difficulty of the favor and the figure's prominence.
