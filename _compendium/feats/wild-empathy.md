# Wild Empathy  *Feat 2*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  


You have a connection to the creatures of the natural world that allows you to communicate with them on a rudimentary level. You can use [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) on animals and to make very simple [Requests](request.md) of them. In most cases, wild animals will give you time to make your case.
