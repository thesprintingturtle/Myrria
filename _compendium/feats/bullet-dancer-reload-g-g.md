# Bullet Dancer Reload  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bullet Dancer Burn](bullet-dancer-burn-g-g.md)
- **Requirements**: You're in Bullet Dancer Stance
- **Activity** Single Action

You've learned to reload your simple firearms with uncanny grace, the ammunition simply falling into place as though part of a well-practiced kata. You [Strike](strike.md) with a simple firearm, and then [Interact](interact.md) to reload that same firearm. You don't need a free hand to reload your simple firearm in this way.
