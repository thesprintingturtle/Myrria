# Archaeologist's Luck  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [fortune](fortune.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archaeologist Dedication](archaeologist-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Trigger** You fail a check against a trap, such as a [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check to [Disable](disable-a-device.md) the trap or a Reflex save to avoid its effects.

You are more than just skillful; your drive to find the secrets of the past manifests as a strange kind of luck. Reroll the failed check and use the new result.
