# Phase Out  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 6*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [evolution](evolution-som.md)  [summoner](rules/traits/summoner-som.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: your eidolon is a phantom
- **Activity** Three-Action

Your eidolon phases out of reality slightly, gaining resistance to all damage (except force and negative) equal to half your level. It's not incorporeal, but it can't use [Strikes](strike.md) or actions that require a fully physical form, such as [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md). Your eidolon can return to its normal form with a single action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait.
