# Takedown Expert  *Feat 1*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  


You've mastered combat practices that let you get up close and bring down perpetrators alive. You can use your Intelligence modifier on attack rolls when you [Devise a Stratagem](devise-a-stratagem-apg.md) if you're using a weapon of the club group in one hand (like a club, staff, or sap), in addition to the usual weapons, and those [Strikes](strike.md) qualify for your strategic strike. Additionally, you can make any of your [Strikes](strike.md) nonlethal without taking the normal â€“2 penalty.
