# Water Sprint  *Feat 7*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

Experience and training have taught you that water has just enough surface tension for a master sprinter to traverse the surface. When you [Stride](stride.md) in a straight line, if you move at least half your Speed over ground, you can move any amount of the remaining distance across a level body of water. If you don't end your [Stride](stride.md) on solid ground, you fall into the water.

If you're legendary in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics), as long as you start on solid ground, any part of your [Stride](stride.md) can cross the water's surface, even if you aren't moving a straight line, though you still fall into the water if you don't end your movement on solid ground.
