# Forced Entry  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics), [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)

You are trained to preserve the archaeological value of your location when entering. You don't take a penalty to [Force Open](force-open.md) doors, windows, or containers without a crowbar. If you roll a success on a check to [Force Open](force-open.md), you get a critical success instead.
