# Instinctive Strike  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [manipulate](manipulate.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acute Scent](acute-scent.md) or precise or imprecise [scent](scent.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You trust your instincts and your sense of smell, using all of your senses to pinpoint your opponent's location. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against an opponent that isn't hiding its scent with an effect like negate aroma. This attack ignores any flat check required due to the target being [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden).
