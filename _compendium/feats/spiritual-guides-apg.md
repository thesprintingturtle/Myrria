# Spiritual Guides  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [fortune](fortune.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: spirit instinct
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You fail, but don't critically fail, a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check or a skill check.
- **Activity** Reaction

Though no one sees them and only you can hear them, the spirits around you constantly chatter, save when you are [raging](rules/actions/rage.md). Sometimes they're even [helpful](conditions.md#Helpful). You can heed the spirits' guidance to reroll the triggering check, using the second result even if it's worse.
