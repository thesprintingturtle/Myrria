# Flensing Slice  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication](dual-weapon-warrior-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a Double Slice, and both attacks hit the target.
- **Activity** Single Action

When you hit with both attacks with Double Slice, you flense the target, making it bleed and creating a weak spot. The target takes `1d8` [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) per weapon damage die of whichever of the weapons you used that has the most weapon damage dice (maximum `4d8` for a major striking weapon). The target becomes [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed), and its resistances to any physical damage types are reduced by 5; these two effects last until the beginning of your next turn.
