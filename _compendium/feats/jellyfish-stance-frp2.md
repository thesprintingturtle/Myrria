# Jellyfish Stance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](stance.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You relax your posture and loosen your joints, allowing yourself to move with incredible fluidity. You can make stinging lash attacks that deal `1d8` slashing damage. These attacks are in the brawling, and have the finesse, nonlethal, [reach](reach.md), and [unarmed](unarmed.md) traits.

While in Jellyfish Stance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves and on checks to [Escape](escape.md) and [Squeeze](squeeze.md).
