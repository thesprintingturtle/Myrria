- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](mummy-dedication-botd.md)

You crumble to pieces, becoming composed of the very terrain to which you're bound, with the effects of the [gaseous form](../spells/gaseous-form.md) spell, or you reconstitute into your normal form. The substance you're formed of depends upon your bound terrain, and the action gains the corresponding trait or traits.

- **Arctic** Snow ([water](water.md))
- **Desert** Sand ([earth](earth.md))
- **Mountain** Cloud ([water](water.md))
- **Swamp** Mud ([earth](earth.md), [water](water.md))
