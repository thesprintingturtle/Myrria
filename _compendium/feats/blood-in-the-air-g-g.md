# Blood In The Air  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: An enemy you've damaged with a ranged weapon during the last minute is [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from you.
- **Activity** Single Action

Once you've locked on to a target, little can obscure your aim. Make a ranged weapon [Strike](strike.md) against the required target. This [Strike](strike.md) ignores the target's [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition and reduces the flat check for the [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) condition from 11 to 5.
