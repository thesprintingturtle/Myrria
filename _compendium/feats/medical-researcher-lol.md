# Medical Researcher  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [rare](rare.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)

Kassi has taught you not only how to apply medicines with your medical skills but how to craft them as well. When you [Craft](craft.md) healer's kits, vaccines, addiction suppressants, antidotes, antiplagues, elixirs of life, or other non-magical medical or healing items, you can use [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) instead of [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting).
