# Changeling Lore  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](changeling-b1.md)  


All too aware of your true nature, you've studied hags and their powers. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) and [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Hag Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
