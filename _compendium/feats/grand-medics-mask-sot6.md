# Grand Medic's Mask  *Feat 20*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  [rare](rare.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Druid Dedication or Wizard Dedication

Your mask is infused with restorative magic associated with Ibex, the Flourishing Field, so it constantly repairs itself. You gain fast healing 5. If you lose a limb or other body part, it regrows within 1 day. Immediately after you Cast a non-cantrip Spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to have the spell also give that creature temporary Hit Points equal to the spell's level until the start of your next turn.
