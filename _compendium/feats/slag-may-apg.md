[changeling](changeling-b1.md)  [lineage](lineage-apg.md)  


Your mother was an annis hag, known for physical prowess, and you have one violet or steel-gray eye. You have thick, sturdy claws made of cold iron that grow naturally from your body. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals `1d6` slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group, have the [unarmed](unarmed.md) and [grapple](rules/traits/grapple.md) traits, and are cold iron.
