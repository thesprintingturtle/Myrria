# Returning Throw  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 9*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You have mastered the technique of arcing a projectile so that it returns to your hand after being thrown, though this requires a moment to precisely calculate the trajectory and possible ricochets. Make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) with a thrown weapon. Once the [Strike](strike.md) is complete, the weapon arcs or ricochets back to your hand. If your hands are full when the weapon returns, it falls to the ground in your space.
