# Lunging Spellstrike  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 10*  
[arcane](arcane.md)  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](spellstrike-som.md), twisting tree hybrid study
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a staff.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your spell unwinds the structure of your staff to make it exceptionally long, or even separate it into shards held together by magical power. Make a [Spellstrike](spellstrike-som.md) with a staff, with a spell that isn't a cantrip or focus spell. Increase the staff's reach by 5 feet Ã— the spell's level.
