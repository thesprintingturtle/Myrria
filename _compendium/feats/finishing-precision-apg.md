# Finishing Precision  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swashbuckler Dedication](swashbuckler-dedication-apg.md)

You've learned how to land daring blows when you have panache. You gain the precise strike|swashbuckler|apg|1 class feature but you deal 1 additional damage on a hit and `1d6` damage on a finisher. This damage doesn't increase as you gain levels. In addition, you gain the Basic Finisher action.

Basic Finisher [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") ([finisher](finisher-apg.md), [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)) You make a graceful, deadly attack. Make a [Strike](strike.md); if you hit and your weapon qualifies for precise strike, you deal the full `1d6` damage from precise strike.
