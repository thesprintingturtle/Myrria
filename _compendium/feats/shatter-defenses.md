# Shatter Defenses  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [press](press.md)  

- **Requirements**: A [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creature is in your melee reach.
- **Activity** Single Action

Your offense exploits your enemy's fear. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against a [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creature. If you hit and deal damage, the target becomes [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) until its [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition ends. If the target was already [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you when you damaged it with this [Strike](strike.md), it can't reduce its [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) value below 1 until the start of your next turn.
