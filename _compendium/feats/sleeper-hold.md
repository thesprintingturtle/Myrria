[incapacitation](incapacitation.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Single Action

You pinch crucial points of your target's nervous system, impeding its ability to function. Attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) the creature, with the following success and critical success effects instead of the usual effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target falls [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) for 1 minute, though it remains standing and doesn't drop what it holds.
> - **Success** The target is [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) until the end of its next turn.
