# Round Ears  *Feat 1*  
[half-elf](half-elf.md)  


Your elven lineage is subtle enough that you look barely different from other humans, and you've learned to use that to your advantage. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) (or another skill of your choice, if you were already trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception))

You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to [Impersonate](impersonate.md) checks to pretend you aren't a halfelf.

Observers are never granted circumstance bonuses to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks due to you [Impersonating](impersonate.md) a full-blooded human, and you never take circumstance penalties due to you Impersonating a full-blooded human.

**Special.** You can take this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain out of this feat or into this feat.
