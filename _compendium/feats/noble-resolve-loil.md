Once, genies ruled vast kingdoms, and a remnant of that confidence and power is reflected in your strong will. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Will saves against effects with the [mental](mental.md) trait. Regardless of success or failure, you become aware of the person who used the effect on you if they were visible to you at the time of use.
