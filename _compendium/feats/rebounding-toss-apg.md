# Rebounding Toss  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 2*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a thrown weapon.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You bounce your weapon off one foe to strike another. Make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) with a thrown weapon. If this [Strike](strike.md) hits, the weapon rebounds toward an enemy within 10 feet of the original target. Make an additional [Strike](strike.md) against this second target. Both attacks count toward your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after you've made both attacks.
