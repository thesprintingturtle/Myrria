[halfling](halfling.md)

You can use creatures that are at least one size larger than you (usually Medium or larger) as cover for the [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](sneak.md) actions, though you still can't use such creatures as cover for other uses, such as the [Take Cover](take-cover.md) action.
