# Shattering Strike  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Improvised Pummel](improvised-pummel-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An improvised weapon that you are wielding becomes [broken](conditions.md#Broken) as a result of a critical success on an [Improvised Pummel](improvised-pummel-apg.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

The improvised weapon shatters, destroying it completely but dealing an additional `3d6` piercing damage to the creature you hit with the Improvised Pummel. This extra damage you apply on the critical hit doesn't double from the critical hit, as normal.
