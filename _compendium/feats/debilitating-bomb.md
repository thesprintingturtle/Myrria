# Debilitating Bomb  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 6*  
[additive <2>](additive.md)  [alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Trigger** You use [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) to craft an alchemical bomb that is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

Your bombs impose additional effects on your enemies. You mix a substance into the bomb that causes one of the following: [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled), [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened), [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed), or a â€“5-foot status penalty to Speeds. If the attack with that bomb hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or suffer that effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for this saving throw (even if someone else throws the bomb).

## Debilitating Bomb leads to...

[Greater Debilitating Bomb](greater-debilitating-bomb.md), [True Debilitating Bomb](true-debilitating-bomb.md)
