# Dustsoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](lineage-apg.md)  [oread](oread-b2.md)  


Your earth elemental ancestor's influence manifests in you as dust and dirt, like the soil of a field or the hot desert sands. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival). If you would automatically become trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You can sustain yourself on dirt and ash instead of normal food and water.
