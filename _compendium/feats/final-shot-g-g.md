# Final Shot  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*  
[gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding an unloaded firearm.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You jam a triple charge of black powder into your weapon to unleash a devastating but risky and inaccurate attack. [Interact](interact.md) to reload, expending three doses of black powder in addition to your normal black powder or ammunition, then [Strike](strike.md) with your firearm against a creature within the weapon's first range increment. If you roll a success, the attack is instead a critical success, but if you roll a failure, the weapon misfires.

Regardless of your roll, after the attack you're [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) until the start of your next turn and [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).
