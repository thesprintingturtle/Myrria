# Skin Split  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[nagaji](nagaji-loil.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You claw open the top layer of your scales and peel off the premature shed in order to remove harmful substances from your skin.

You immediately end all [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from effects that coat your skin (such as fire and most [persistent acid damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage)). If you're suffering from an effect other than [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) that depends on continuous contact with your skin, and if that effect allows a saving throw, immediately attempt a new saving throw against that effect.
