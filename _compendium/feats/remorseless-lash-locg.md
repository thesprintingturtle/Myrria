# Remorseless Lash  *Feat 1*  
[hobgoblin](hobgoblin-locg.md)  


You're skilled at beating a foe when their morale is already breaking. When you succeed at a melee weapon [Strike](strike.md) against a [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) foe, that foe can't reduce their [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition below 1 until the beginning of your next turn.
