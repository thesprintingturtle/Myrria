# Darting Monkey  *Feat 5*  
[vanara](vanara-loil.md)  


You have a heightened awareness in combat, and your darting strikes prevent your foes from distracting you or breaking your focus. When you hit a creature of your level or lower while that creature is flanking you, flanking doesn't make you [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to that creature. This benefit lasts until the start of your next turn or until the creature moves, whichever comes first. The creature can still help its other allies flank.
