# Diverse Lore  *Feat 1*  
[thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  


Your wandering studies mean you've heard rumors or theories about almost every topic... though admittedly, your sources aren't always the most reliable. You can take a â€“2 penalty to your check to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) with [Esoteric Lore](../skills.md#Lore) to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) about any topic, not just the usual topics available for [Esoteric Lore](../skills.md#Lore). Additionally, when you succeed at your check to Exploit a Vulnerability, compare the result of your [Esoteric Lore](../skills.md#Lore) check to the DC to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) for that creature; if that number would be a success or a critical success, you gain information as if you had succeeded at the [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) check.
