# Legendary Medic  *Feat 15*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)

You've discovered medical breakthroughs or techniques that achieve miraculous results. Once per day for each target, you can spend 1 hour treating that target and attempt a [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) check to remove a disease or the [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded), [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened), [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed), or [drained](conditions.md#Drained) condition. Use the DC of the disease or of the spell or effect that created the condition. If the effect's source is an artifact, above 20th level, or similarly powerful, increase the DC by 10.
