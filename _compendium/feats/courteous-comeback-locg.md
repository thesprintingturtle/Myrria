# Courteous Comeback  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 1*  
[fortune](fortune.md)  [human](human.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Keleshite nationality
- **Trigger** You critically fail a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check.
- **Requirements**: You're in a settlement or community, and you haven't used Courteous Comeback in this settlement or community within the past month.
- **Activity** Free Action

You grew up in the proud Padishah Empire, where even insults have a certain poetic wit. Reroll the triggering [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check, using the second result.
