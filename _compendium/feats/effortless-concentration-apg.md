# Effortless Concentration  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 16*  
[witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You maintain your active spells with hardly a thought. You immediately gain the effects of a [Sustain a Spell](sustain-a-spell.md) action, allowing you to extend the duration of one of your active witch spells.
