# Dual Onslaught  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Dual-Weapon Dedication

When you lash out with both weapons, you leave no room for the target to escape your attack. When you use [Double Slice](double-slice.md), if you miss with both [Strikes](strike.md), choose one of the two weapons and apply the effects of a hit with that weapon. You can't choose a weapon if your attack roll with that weapon was a critical failure, meaning you still miss entirely if both attack rolls were critical failures.
