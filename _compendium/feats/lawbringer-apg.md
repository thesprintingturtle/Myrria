# Lawbringer  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](aasimar-apg.md)  [lineage](lineage-apg.md)  


You trace your lineage to archons: embodiments of heavenly virtues, guardians of the seven-tiered mountain of Heaven, and nurturers of law and virtue within mortals. Your own virtue and orderly mind protect you from foes who would turn your emotions against you. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [emotion](emotion.md) effects, and if you roll a success on a save against an [emotion](emotion.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.

## Lawbringer leads to...

[Archon Magic](archon-magic-apg.md), [Enforced Order](enforced-order-loag.md)
