# Nonlethal Spell  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[manipulate](manipulate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You can alter offensive spells to be less deadly. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) that deals damage and doesn't have the [death](death.md) or [negative](negative.md) trait, that spell gains the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md) trait.
