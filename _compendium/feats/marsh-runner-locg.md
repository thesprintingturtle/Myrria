# Marsh Runner  *Feat 1*  
[lizardfolk](lizardfolk-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: You have a swim Speed.

You are adept at moving through marshy terrain. When you use the [Step](step.md) action, you can ignore difficult terrain caused by flooding, swamps, or quicksand. In addition, when you use the [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) skill to [Balance](balance.md) on narrow surfaces or uneven marshy ground, you aren't [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed), and if you roll a success on the [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check, you get a critical success instead.
