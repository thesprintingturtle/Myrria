# Expand Spiral  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spiral Sworn](spiral-sworn-botd.md)

Your prayers encompass your companions, granting you the ability to share [Pharasma](../setting/deities/pharasma.md)'s blessings. When you use Spiral Sworn, you can spend 2 actions instead of 1 to grant the benefits to all allies who are in the light of your spiral when you take the action.
