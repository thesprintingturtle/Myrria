# Shadow Hunter  *Feat 18*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Camouflage](camouflage.md)

You blend in to your surroundings so well that others have trouble telling you apart from the terrain. While in natural terrain, you're always [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) from all foes if you choose to be, except for your [hunted prey](hunt-prey.md).
