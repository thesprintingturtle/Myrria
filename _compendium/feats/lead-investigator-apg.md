# Lead Investigator  *Feat 18*  
[exploration](exploration.md)  [investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clue Them All In](clue-them-all-in-apg.md)

You spend 1 minute briefing up to four allies about one lead you're pursuing. Those allies gain the same circumstance bonus you do from [Pursue a Lead](pursue-a-lead-apg.md) to checks to investigate that lead. This bonus lasts until you cease pursing that lead or for 1 day, whichever comes first. This doesn't confer any other benefits of pursuing a lead, such as adding the circumstance bonus to your saves with Detective's Readiness.
