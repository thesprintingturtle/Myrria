# Form Lock  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [attack](attack.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Wrestler Dedication](wrestler-dedication-lotgb.md)
- **Requirements**: You have a creature [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Single Action

Your ability to manipulate your enemy's body is potent enough that you can tear and break apart alternate forms. Attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to counteract a [polymorph](polymorph.md) effect currently affecting the creature you have [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained). If the target is somehow under the effect of multiple [polymorph](polymorph.md) effects, you can choose which one to attempt to counteract; the GM chooses randomly if the separate effects aren't obvious. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
