# You're Next (Swashbuckler)  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[emotion](emotion.md)  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Trigger** You reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points.
- **Activity** Reaction

After downing a foe, you promise another you're coming after them next. Attempt an [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check with a +2 circumstance bonus to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) a single creature that you can see and that can see you. If you're legendary in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation), you can use this as a free action with the same trigger.
