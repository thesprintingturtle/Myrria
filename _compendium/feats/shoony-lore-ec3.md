# Shoony Lore  *Feat 1*  
[shoony](shoony-ec3.md)  


Growing up in shoony society, you learned the value of honesty, friendship, and hard work, even during trying times. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Survival](../skills.md#Survival). If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in [Shoony Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
