# Crystal Healing  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [healing](healing.md)  [manipulate](manipulate.md)  [skill](skill.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism)

You know how to stimulate a body's natural healing abilities through the application of resonant crystals. Doing so requires you to use at least two semiprecious stones with a total value of 5 gp or more in place of healer's tools, which allows you to attempt to [Treat Disease](treat-disease.md) or [Treat Poison](treat-poison.md) using [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) rather than [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine). Examples and prices of semiprecious stones can be found on page 114 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide.

If you're an expert in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) and you use gems whose total value equals or exceeds 50 gp, you gain a +1 item bonus to your [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) check. If you're a master and the gems' value equals or exceeds 700 gp, the item bonus increases to +2; if you're legendary in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) and the gems' value equals or exceeds 15,000 gp, the item bonus increases to +3.
