# Haughty Obstinacy  *Feat 1*  
[human](human.md)  


Your powerful ego makes it harder for others to order you around. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a [mental](mental.md) effect that attempts to directly control your actions, you critically succeed instead. If a creature rolls a failure on a check to [Coerce](coerce.md) you using [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation), it gets a critical failure instead (so it can't try to [Coerce](coerce.md) you again for 1 week).
