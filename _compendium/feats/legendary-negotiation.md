# Legendary Negotiation  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 15*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)
- **Activity** Three-Action

You can negotiate incredibly quickly in adverse situations. You attempt to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) and then [Request](request.md) your opponent cease their current activity and engage in negotiations. You take a –5 penalty to your [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check. The GM sets the DC of the [Request](request.md) based on the circumstances—it's generally at least a very hard DC of the creature's level. Some creatures might simply refuse, and even those who agree to parley might ultimately find your arguments lacking and return to violence.
