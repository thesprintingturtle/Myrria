# Schooled In Secrets  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism)

You notice the signs and symbols that members of mystery cults and other secret societies use to declare their affiliation to fellow members. You can use [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism) in place of [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Gather Information](gather-information.md) about such groups. If you belong to a secret cult, lodge, sect, or similar organization, you automatically recognize members of your group unless they are specifically attempting to conceal their presence from you.
