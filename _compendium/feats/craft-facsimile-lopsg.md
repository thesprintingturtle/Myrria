# Craft Facsimile  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)

You're renowned for your ability to recover important items, whether they're from a long-abandoned temple or a thieves' den, and sometimes that requires creating a stand-in. You can spend 1 minute to assemble a facsimile of an object of no more than 1 Bulk that you can see from available materials. The facsimile has the same shape and Bulk as the replaced object and can pass as the object if not examined.

A creature familiar with the original who examines the object automatically realizes that it is a fake. A creature not familiar with the original can still tell it was a hastily jury-rigged stand-in of some kind, but they might not know the object was supposed to be something else.
