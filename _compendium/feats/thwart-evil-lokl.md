# Thwart Evil  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md), master in [Religion](../skills.md#Religion)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** A creature you can see uses a spell or ability that has the [evil](evil.md) or [negative](negative.md) traits.
- **Activity** Reaction

You react instinctively when you sense evil forming, thrusting your spiritual energy toward the source to snuff out evil before it fully manifests. Attempt to counteract the triggering spell or ability using your [Religion](../skills.md#Religion) modifier as your counteract modifier.
