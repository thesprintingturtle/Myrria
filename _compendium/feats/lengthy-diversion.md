# Lengthy Diversion  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)

When you critically succeed to [Create a Diversion](create-a-diversion.md), you continue to remain [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) after the end of your turn. This effect lasts for an amount of time that depends on the diversion and situation, as determined by the GM (minimum 1 additional round).
