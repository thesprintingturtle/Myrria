# Ankle Bite  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 5*  
[goblin](goblin.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fang Sharpener](fang-sharpener-locg.md) or razortooth goblin heritage
- **Trigger** A foe gives you the [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) condition using a part of its body.
- **Activity** Reaction

Whenever someone grabs onto you, you instinctively bite down hard. Sometimes that makes them let go, and sometimes it just makes them angrier, but either way, it's both satisfying and tasty. Make a jaws [Strike](strike.md) against the triggering foe.

On a critical hit, you are no longer [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed). This [Strike](strike.md) doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](strike.md).
