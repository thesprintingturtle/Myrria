# Quick Disguise  *Feat 2*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception)

You can set up a disguise in half the usual time (generally 5 minutes). If you're a master, it takes one-tenth the usual time (usually 1 minute). If you're legendary, you can create a full disguise and [Impersonate](impersonate.md) as a 3-action activity.
