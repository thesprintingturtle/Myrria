# Paragon's Guard  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [stance](stance.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a shield.
- **Activity** Single Action

Once you've had a moment to set your stance, you always have your shield ready without a thought. While you are in this stance, you constantly have your shield raised as if you'd used the [Raise a Shield](raise-a-shield.md) action, as long as you meet that action's requirements.
