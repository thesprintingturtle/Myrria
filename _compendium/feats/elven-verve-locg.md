# Elven Verve  *Feat 1*  
[elf](elf.md)  


While all elves are immune to the paralyzing touch of ghouls, you can shake off flesh-numbing magic of all kinds. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against effects that would impose the [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) conditions. When you would be [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for at least 2 rounds, reduce that duration by 1 round.
