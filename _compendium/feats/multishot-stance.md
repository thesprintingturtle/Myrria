# Multishot Stance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [stance](stance.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Triple Shot](triple-shot.md)
- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged weapon with [reload 0](reload.md).
- **Activity** Single Action

You lock yourself in a stable position so you can fire swiftly and accurately. While you are in this stance, your penalty for [Double Shot](double-shot.md) is reduced to –1, or –2 if you add the extra action to make three [Strikes](strike.md). If you move from your position, this stance ends.
