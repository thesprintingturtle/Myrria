# Antagonize  *Feat 2*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  


Your taunts and threats earn your foes ire. When you successfully [Demoralize](demoralize.md) a creature, its [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition can't decrease to less than 1 at the end of its turn until it either uses a [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) action against you or can no longer observe or sense you for at least 1 round.
