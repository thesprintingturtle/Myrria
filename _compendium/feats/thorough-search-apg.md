# Thorough Search  *Feat 3*  
[general](general.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Perception](../skills.md#Perception)

You take your time searching to ensure you find everything. When [Searching](search.md), you can take twice as long to search. Normally this means you [Search](search.md) at up to one quarter of your Speed, to a maximum of 150 feet per minute to check everything, or 75 feet per minute to check everything before you walk into it. If you do, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](seek.md).
