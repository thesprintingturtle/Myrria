# Effortless Concentration (Druid)  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 16*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Trigger** Your turn begins.
- **Activity** Free Action

You maintain a spell with hardly a thought. You immediately gain the effects of the [Sustain a Spell](sustain-a-spell.md) action, allowing you to extend the duration of one of your active druid spells.
