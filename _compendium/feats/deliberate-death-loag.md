# Deliberate Death  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[duskwalker](duskwalker-apg.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You are about to gain the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition as a result of another creature's attack or ability, and that creature is within your melee reach.
- **Activity** Reaction

Once, you died because someone—murderer or monster, soldier or executioner— chose to strike you down. Just before losing consciousness, make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against the triggering creature.

**Special.** You can select this feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.
