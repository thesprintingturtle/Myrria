[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)

You can [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) without waiting for 1 minute after the previous [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md) (or 1 round, with quick rage), but when you end this second [Rage](rules/actions/rage.md), you're [fatigued](conditions.md#Fatigued) until you rest for 10 minutes.
