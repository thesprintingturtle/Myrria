# Dual Finisher  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[finisher](finisher-apg.md)  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Requirements**: You wield two melee weapons, one in each hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You split your attacks. Make two melee [Strikes](strike.md), one with each required weapon, each against a different foe. If the second [Strike](strike.md) is made with a non-[agile](agile.md) weapon, it takes a â€“2 penalty.

Increase your multiple attack penalty only after attempting both [Strikes](strike.md).
