# Talismanic Sage  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Talisman Dabbler Dedication](talisman-dabbler-dedication-apg.md)

You have forgotten more about talismans than lesser warriors have ever known. Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you [Affix a Talisman](affix-a-talisman.md), you can specially treat one item you're working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once. This special treatment ends if you use [Affix a Talisman](affix-a-talisman.md) to treat a new item for this ability.
