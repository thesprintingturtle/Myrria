[archetype](archetype.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in a [Decipher Writing](decipher-writing.md) skill, [Scrollmaster Dedication](scrollmaster-dedication-locg.md)

When you [Decipher Writing](decipher-writing.md), you need only half as long as usual (reducing the time from about 1 minute to about half a minute per page), and if you fail, you don't take the usual â€“2 circumstance penalty to further checks to decipher that text.
