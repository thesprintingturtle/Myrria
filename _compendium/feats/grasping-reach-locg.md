# Grasping Reach  *Feat 1*  
[leshy](leshy-b1.md)  


You can extend a tangle of vines or tendrils to support your arms and extend your reach. When you wield a melee weapon that requires two hands, doesn't have reach, and deals at least `1d6` damage, you can change between a typical two-handed grip and an extended two-handed grasp using an [Interact](interact.md) action. Weapons wielded in your extended grasp gain reach of 10 feet. This grasp is less stable and powerful than a typical grip, reducing the weapon's damage die by 1 step.
