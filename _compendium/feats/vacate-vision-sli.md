# Vacate Vision  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Oozemorph Dedication](oozemorph-dedication-sli.md)
- **Trigger** You fail (but don't critically fail) a saving throw against an effect with the [visual](visual.md) trait.
- **Activity** Reaction

You cause your eyes to liquefy and run out of your eye sockets, leaving them empty. You get a success on the save against the triggering effect, but you are [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) for the duration the effect would have had on a failure. At that time, your eyes regrow and your normal vision returns.
