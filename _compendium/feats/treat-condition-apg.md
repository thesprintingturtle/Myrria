# Treat Condition  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [healing](healing.md)  [manipulate](manipulate.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Medic Dedication](medic-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: You are holding healer's tools, or you are wearing them and have a hand free.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You treat an adjacent creature in an attempt to reduce the [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy), [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled), or [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened) condition. If a creature has multiple conditions from this list, choose one. Attempt a counteract check against the condition, using your [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) modifier as your counteract modifier and the condition's source to determine the DC. You can't treat a condition that came from an artifact or effect above 20th level unless you have [Legendary Medic](legendary-medic.md); even if you do, the counteract DC increases by 10. Treating a Condition that is continually applied under certain circumstances (for instance, the [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition a good character gains from carrying an [unholy weapon](../equipment/items/unholy.md)) has no effect as long as the circumstances continue.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Reduce the condition value by 2.
> - **Success** Reduce the condition value by 1.
> - **Critical Failure** Increase the condition value by 1.
