# Dodging Roll  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics)
- **Trigger** You take damage from an area effect that allows a Reflex save.
- **Activity** Reaction

You dodge a blow at the last possible moment. You [Step](step.md) and gain resistance to all damage equal to your level against the triggering effect. If your [Step](step.md) moves you out of the triggering effect's area, this resistance is instead equal to your level plus your Dexterity modifier.
