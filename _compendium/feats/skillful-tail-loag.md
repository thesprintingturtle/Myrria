# Skillful Tail ()  *Feat 5*  
[ifrit](ifrit-b2.md)  [oread](oread-b2.md)  [suli](suli-b2.md)  [sylph](sylph-b2.md)  [undine](undine-b2.md)  


You were born with a tail, and with practice you've learned how to perform simple [Interact](interact.md) actions with it, such as opening an unlocked door. Your tail can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.
