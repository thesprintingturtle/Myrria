# Warren Navigator  *Feat 1*  
[ratfolk](ratfolk-b1.md)  


You're particularly good at solving mazes and navigating twists and turns. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival).

If you would automatically become trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice. When you [Sense Direction](sense-direction.md) or attempt a roll against a [maze](../spells/maze.md) spell, you get a result one degree of success better than you rolled. You don't take a penalty to [Sense Direction](sense-direction.md) when you lack a compass.
