Your reports are thorough and informative, and putting your thoughts to paper helps you retain the information. Keep track of each type of creature you successfully identify with [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md). When attempting [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) checks against creatures on your list in later encounters, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus, and you learn an additional fact about such creatures on a success.
