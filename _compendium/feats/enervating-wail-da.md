# Enervating Wail  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[auditory](auditory.md)  [deviant](deviant-da.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [rare](rare.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You release a terrible wail that tears at the spirits of all nearby.

All living creatures in a 20-foot emanation take negative damage with a basic Fortitude save. The damage is `4d6`, plus `1d6` for every level you have beyond 6th.

**Awakening** Your scream echoes in the mind. You can choose to emit a silent psychic wail instead, which changes the damage type to mental, changes the save to a Will save, removes the [auditory](auditory.md) trait, and adds the [mental](mental.md) trait.

**Awakening** Your wail saps your foes' strength. In addition to the normal effects, living creatures in the area are [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round on a success (but not a critical success), [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute on a failure, and [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute on a critical failure.
