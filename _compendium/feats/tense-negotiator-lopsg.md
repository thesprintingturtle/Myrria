# Tense Negotiator  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](swordmaster-dedication-locg.md), master in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)

You often find that the best way to win a conflict means avoiding a fight in the first place. You're good at talking to potential opponents without making things worse.

If you would critically fail at a check to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md), you instead fail. You can attempt checks to make Requests of creatures who're [indifferent](conditions.md#Indifferent) or [unfriendly](conditions.md#Unfriendly) toward you.
