# Sticky Bomb  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 8*  
[additive <2>](additive.md)  [alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Trigger** You use [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) to craft an alchemical bomb, and that bomb's level is at least 2 levels lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

You mix in an additive to make your bomb's contents adhere to the target and continue to deal damage. A creature that takes a direct hit from one of your sticky bombs also takes [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to and of the same type as the bomb's splash damage. If the bomb already deals [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), combine the two amounts.
