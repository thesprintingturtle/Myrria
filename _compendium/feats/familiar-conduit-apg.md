# Familiar Conduit  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Familiar Master Dedication](familiar-master-dedication-apg.md), able to cast spells
- **Requirements**: You have line of effect to your familiar.
- **Activity** Single Action

Under your tutelage, your familiar has grown attuned to the hidden currents of the world and can serve as a conduit for your magic. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) that has a range, the spell uses the familiar as its origin point.
