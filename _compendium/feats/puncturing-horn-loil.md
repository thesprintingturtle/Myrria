# Puncturing Horn  *Feat 1*  
[kashrishi](kashrishi-loil.md)  


While many kashrishi never use their horns for more than cracking open hard-shelled fruits or amplifying their psychic powers, you've practiced using yours offensively. You gain a horn unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage. Your horn is in the brawling group and has the [finesse](finesse.md) and [unarmed](unarmed.md) traits.

**Special.** If you have the xyloshi heritage, your horn instead deals `1d8` piercing damage.
