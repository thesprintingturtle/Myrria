Your detachable limbs offer flexibility. You [Interact](interact.md) to remove your arm and wield it in the other one, increasing your reach by 5 feet for any one-handed weapon held in that arm. If your next action is a [Strike](strike.md) with that weapon, creatures that were outside your reach that you can now hit are [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your first attack. You don't have a free hand while holding the arm. You can [Interact](interact.md) to reattach the arm while holding it.
