# Fey Transcendence  *Feat 17*  
[rare](rare.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Fey Influence](fey-influence-loil.md)

You become a powerful fey creature, gaining strengths tied to the First World but also some of the weakness against which all fey must contend. You gain a +2 status bonus to saves against illusion, [emotion](emotion.md), and [enchantment](enchantment.md) effects, and you can use [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) on and to make very simple Requests of animals and plants. You regain twice the number of Hit Points when resting in a natural wooded area, such as a forest or jungle. You have weakness to cold iron equal to half your level.

**Special.** This feat gains the trait appropriate for your ancestry (human for human, goblin for goblin, etc.).
