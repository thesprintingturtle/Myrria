# Shadow Blending  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[fetchling](fetchling-b2.md)  [illusion](illusion.md)  [occult](occult.md)  [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature attempts a flat check to target you while you're [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) due to dim light or darkness.
- **Activity** Reaction

You draw shadows close to create a shroud. Increase the DC of the flat check by 2.
