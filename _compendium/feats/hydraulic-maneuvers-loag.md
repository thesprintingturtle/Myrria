# Hydraulic Maneuvers  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*

- **Activity** Single Action

You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your surroundings. If the next action you take is an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md), that action has a range of 15 feet. You don't receive any item bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body, but if you roll a critical failure on that [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check, you get a failure instead.
