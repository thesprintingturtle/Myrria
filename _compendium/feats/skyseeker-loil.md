# Skyseeker  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [electricity](electricity.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [sonic](sonic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Sky and Heaven Stance
- **Requirements**: You're in Sky and Heaven Stance.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You [Leap](leap.md) toward an opponent. At any point in the [Leap](leap.md), you can make a single [Strike](strike.md) against a creature within your reach. At 12th level, if you hit with this [Strike](strike.md), instead of finishing your [Leap](leap.md), you can immediately attempt a second [Leap](leap.md) from the space where you struck the target of your [Strike](strike.md). You can make a single [Strike](strike.md) against a target within your reach during this second [Leap](leap.md) as well. At 16th level, you can attempt a third [Leap](leap.md) if your second [Strike](strike.md) hits, and you can attack a target at any point during this third [Leap](leap.md). All Leaps made during this activity gain a +10-foot status bonus to the total height or distance of your leap, and no two Strikes can target the same creature.
