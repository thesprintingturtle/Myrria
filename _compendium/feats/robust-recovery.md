# Robust Recovery  *Feat 2*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine)

You learned folk medicine to help recover from diseases and poison, and using it diligently has made you especially resilient. When you [Treat a Disease](treat-disease.md) or a [Poison](treat-poison.md), or someone else uses one of these actions on you, increase the circumstance bonus granted on a success to +4, and if the result of the patient's saving throw is a success, the patient gets a critical success.
