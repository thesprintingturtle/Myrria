# Magic Hands  *Feat 6*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Healing Hands](healing-hands.md)

The blessing of your deity heightens your healing ability, making your mundane healing work as if by magic. When you succeed at a [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) check to [Treat Wounds](treat-wounds.md), your action gains the [divine](divine.md) trait and you heal the maximum amount for the `2d8` (or `4d8` on a critical success). If you have an ability that adds additional dice to your [Treat Wounds](treat-wounds.md), you still roll those normally.
