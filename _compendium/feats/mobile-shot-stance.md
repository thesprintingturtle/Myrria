# Mobile Shot Stance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  [stance](stance.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Your shots become nimble and deadly. While you're in this stance, your ranged [Strikes](strike.md) don't trigger Attacks of Opportunity or other reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack. If you have [Attack of Opportunity](rules/actions/attack-of-opportunity.md), you can use it with a loaded ranged weapon you're wielding. The triggering creature must be within 5 feet of you for you to do so.
