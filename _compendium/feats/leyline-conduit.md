# Leyline Conduit  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 20*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  [manipulate](manipulate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

You can cast your spells effortlessly by tapping into the leylines of the world. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) of 5th level or lower that has no duration, you don't expend the prepared spell as you cast it.
