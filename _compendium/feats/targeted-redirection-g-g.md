# Targeted Redirection  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Sniping Duo Dedication](sniping-duo-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You aim a shot at your spotter, intending for your spotter to redirect that shot off their own weapon or shield to hit your foe from a better angle, and avoid your foe's cover.

If your next action is to make a ranged [Strike](strike.md), you treat your spotter's position as your own for the purposes of determining cover and range. Your spotter must be within your weapon's first range increment and they must use a reaction to redirect your shot.
