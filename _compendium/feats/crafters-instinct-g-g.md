# Crafter's Instinct  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 13*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md)  [fortune](fortune.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.
- **Prerequisites**: master in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You misfire with a firearm or you roll a failure on a [Strike](strike.md) with a ranged weapon
- **Activity** Reaction

You sense a minor flaw in the weapon as you fire it, and quickly adjust your aim on the fly to avoid the flaw. If the triggering [Strike](strike.md) was a misfire, you get a normal failure instead. If the triggering [Strike](strike.md) was a failure, it becomes a glancing blow that deals minimum damage for the [Strike](strike.md) (adding any bonuses as normal but getting a result of 1 for all damage dice that would be rolled on a success). The glancing blow does not apply other effects that would normally happen only on a hit.
