# Arrow Of Death  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 18*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Archer Dedication](eldritch-archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Three-Action

You modify an arrow or bolt to bring death to your target in a single potent hit. Make a bow [Strike](strike.md). On a hit, you deal an additional `10d10` precision damage. On a critical hit, the target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher, or be immediately slain; this save has the [death](death.md) and [incapacitation](incapacitation.md) traits.
