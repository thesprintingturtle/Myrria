# Follow-up Strike  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Martial Artist Dedication](martial-artist-dedication-apg.md)
- **Requirements**: Your last action was a missed [Strike](strike.md) with a melee unarmed attack.
- **Activity** Single Action

You have trained to use all parts of your body as a weapon, and when you miss with an attack, you can usually continue the attack with a different body part and still deal damage.

Make another [Strike](strike.md) with a melee unarmed attack, using the same multiple attack penalty as for the missed [Strike](strike.md), if any.
