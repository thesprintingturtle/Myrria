# Mistsoul  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](lineage-apg.md)  [undine](undine-b2.md)  


You have a connection to vaporous forms of water, such as fog and mist. You gain the Mist Blending reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Mist Blending [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")
[undine](../../../rules/traits/undine-b2.md)  

- **Trigger**: A creature attempts a flat check to target you because you're [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) or [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden) due to fog, haze, mist, or smoke

**Effect** You shroud yourself in mist, making it harder for your foe to hit you. If you're [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed), the DC of the flat check increases from 5 to 7; if you're [hidden](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hidden), it increases from 11 to 13.
