# Eternal Blessing  *Feat 16*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: good alignment

Your good deeds have brought your deity's grace to you for all of eternity. You're continuously surrounded by a [bless](../spells/bless.md) spell with a spell level equal to half your level (rounded up). The radius is 15 feet, and you can't increase it. You can [Dismiss](dismiss.md) the spell; if you do, it returns automatically after 1 minute.
