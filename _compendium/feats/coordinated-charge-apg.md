[archetype](archetype.md)  [open](open.md)  [visual](visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](marshal-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You heroically dash into the fray, inspiring your allies to follow. You [Stride](stride.md) up to your Speed and make a melee [Strike](strike.md).

If your [Strike](strike.md) hits and damages an enemy, each ally within 60 feet who saw you hit can use a reaction to [Stride](stride.md), but they each must end their [Stride](stride.md) closer to the creature you hit than where they started.
