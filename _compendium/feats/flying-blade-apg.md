# Flying Blade  *Feat 1*  
[swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: precise strike

You've learned to apply your flashy techniques to thrown weapons as easily as melee attacks. When you have panache, you apply your precise strike damage on ranged [Strikes](strike.md) you make with a [thrown](thrown.md) weapon within that weapon's first range increment. The thrown weapon must be an [agile](agile.md) or [finesse](finesse.md) weapon. This also allows you to make a thrown weapon ranged [Strike](strike.md) for [Confident Finisher](confident-finisher-apg.md) and any other finisher that includes a [Strike](strike.md) that can benefit from your precise strike.
