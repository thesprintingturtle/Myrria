# Uzunjati Storytelling  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Magaambyan Attendant Dedication](magaambyan-attendant-dedication-locg.md), Uzunjati affiliation, master in a [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) skill
- **Activity** Single Action

You tell a quick story or begin telling a longer tale. This is most useful when you want to prove your scholarly credibility or impress someone quickly. Roll a check with a skill that can be used to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) in which you have expert proficiency, using the result entry for the [Perform](perform.md) action. Like Performing, Storytelling rarely has an effect on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) checks against the observers—or even change their attitudes—if the GM sees fit. This action is not a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) and cannot be used in place of anything that requires you to [Perform](perform.md).

## Uzunjati Storytelling leads to...

[Uzunjati Recollection](uzunjati-recollection-locg.md), [Janatimo's Lessons](janatimos-lessons-lol.md)
