[gnome](gnome.md)

You've spent considerable time practicing the manipulation of light, weaponizing your blade's reflection or bolstering the luminosity of magical displays to unconventional heights. Extend the duration of the [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) or [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) condition you give the target by 1 round.
