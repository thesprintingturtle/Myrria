# Marshal Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [dedication](dedication.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in martial weapons and either [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation)

You've combined your social skills and combat training to become a talented combat leader. Choose [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) or [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation). You become trained in that skill or become an expert if you were already trained in it.

In addition, you're surrounded by a marshal's aura in a 10-foot emanation. Your aura has the [emotion](emotion.md), [mental](mental.md), and [visual](visual.md) traits and grants you and allies within the aura a +1 status bonus to saving throws against [fear](rules/traits/fear.md).

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the marshal archetype.
