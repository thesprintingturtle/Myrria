[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Archer Dedication](archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You slow down, focus, and take a careful shot. Make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) with a weapon in the bow weapon group.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll and ignore the target's [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition. If the target is [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden), reduce the flat check from being [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from 11 to 5.
