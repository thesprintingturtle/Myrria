# Healing Transformation  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You can take advantage of shapechanging magic to close wounds and patch injuries. If your next action is to cast a non-cantrip polymorph spell that targets only one creature, your polymorph spell also restores `1d6` Hit Points per spell level to that creature. This is a [healing](healing.md) effect.
