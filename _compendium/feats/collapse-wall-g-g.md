# Collapse Wall  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Demolitionist Dedication](demolitionist-dedication-g-g.md)
- **Trigger** A creature moves into the bombs' splash area.
- **Requirements**: You're within 30 feet of an area where you rigged bombs on a wall, cliff face, or similar vertical surface with Set Explosives or Demolition Charge
- **Activity** Reaction

You detonate the required bombs in order to bring a wall down on a creature. If your bombs deal enough damage to reduce the wall's Hit Points below its [Broken](conditions.md#Broken) Threshold, the wall partially collapses on the creature. The creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to the damage dealt to the wall (basic Reflex save; the DC for this save is equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). On a failure, they must spend an [Interact](interact.md) action to dig themselves out of the collapse, and on a critical failure, they must spend 2 [Interact](interact.md) actions to do so.
