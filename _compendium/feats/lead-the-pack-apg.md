# Lead The Pack  *Feat 16*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mature Beastmaster Companion](mature-beastmaster-companion-apg.md), you have multiple animal companions

You can have up to two animal companions active at once. However, when you do, it's slightly more difficult to Command them. If you don't Command either of your companions, one of the two (your choice) can still use 1 action on your turn to [Stride](stride.md) or [Strike](strike.md), as per Mature Beastmaster Companion, but not both. When you [Command an Animal](command-an-animal.md), either choose one of the companions to take 2 actions, as normal, or else both companions can take 1 action to [Stride](stride.md) or [Strike](strike.md). Either way, you can't [Command an Animal](command-an-animal.md) to make either companion act again until your next turn.
