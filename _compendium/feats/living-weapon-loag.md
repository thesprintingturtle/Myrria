You've learned to use part of your form as a weapon. When you select this feat, you gain a claws unarmed attack that deals `1d4` slashing damage and has the [agile](agile.md) and [finesse](finesse.md) traits; a horn, jaws, or tusk unarmed attack that deals `1d6` piercing damage and has the versatile S trait; or a tail unarmed attack that deals `1d6` bludgeoning damage and has the [backswing](backswing.md) trait. Each of these unarmed attacks is in the brawling weapon group.

**Special.** You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select a new attack from the options above.
