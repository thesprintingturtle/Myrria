# Gardener's Resolve  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [vigilante](rules/traits/vigilante-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vigilante Dedication](vigilante-dedication-apg.md), member of the Gray Gardeners
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on a Will save against a [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effect.
- **Activity** Reaction

The Gray Gardeners are known for having nerves of steel and an unbreakable resolve. When you would be overwhelmed by terror, you can draw upon this resolve to keep your composure and remain undaunted. You take mental damage equal to twice your level, and the saving throw is a success.
