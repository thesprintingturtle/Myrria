# Scintillating Spell  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [light](rules/traits/light.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

Your spells become a radiant display of light and color. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) that doesn't have the [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md) trait, has no duration, and requires creatures to attempt a Reflex save, the spell explodes in a spray of scintillating lights, in addition to its other effects. Each creature that failed its Reflex save against the spell is [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 round, and those who critically failed are instead [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round.
