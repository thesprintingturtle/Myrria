# Giant's Lunge  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [instinct](instinct.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Giant instinct
- **Activity** Single Action

You extend your body and prepare to attack foes outside your normal reach. Until your rage ends, all your melee weapons and unarmed attacks gain [reach <10>](reach.md). This doesn't increase the reach of any weapon or unarmed attack that already has the [reach](reach.md) trait, but it does combine with abilities that increase your reach due to increased size, such as [Giant's Stature](giants-stature.md).
