[aura](rules/traits/aura.md)  [cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: able to create or control undead; cleric with a negative font, oracle of bones, or necromancer wizard

Your presence has a bolstering effect on your undead minions. Undead creatures under your control and within a 30‑foot emanation around you gain a +2 status bonus to saving throws to resist positive damage and to Will saving throws to resist effects that would make them [controlled](conditions.md#Controlled).

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
