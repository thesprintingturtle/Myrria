- **Frequency**: once per turn
- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip divine spell.
- **Activity** Free Action

You coat a weapon you're wielding in prayers and the divine power given to you by your deity. Until the end of your turn, the weapon deals an extra `1d6` positive damage. As usual for positive damage, this damage harms only undead and creatures with negative healing.
