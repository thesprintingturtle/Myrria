# Bon Mot  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[auditory](auditory.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [emotion](emotion.md)  [general](general.md)  [linguistic](linguistic.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)
- **Activity** Single Action

You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them. Choose a foe within 30 feet and roll a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check against the target's Will DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is distracted and takes a –3 status penalty to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) and Will saves for 1 minute. The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action.
> - **Success** As critical success, but the penalty is –2.
> - **Critical Failure** Your quip is atrocious. You take the same penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.
