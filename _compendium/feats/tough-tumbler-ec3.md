# Tough Tumbler  *Feat 5*  
[shoony](shoony-ec3.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scamper](scamper-apg.md) Underfoot

You've taken your share of licks while scurrying around the battlefield and know how to defend yourself against opportunistic attackers. Your movement ends only when you critically fail an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Tumble Through](tumble-through.md) an enemy's space (or when you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space). You still trigger reactions on a failure to [Tumble Through](tumble-through.md), but you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against attacks that you trigger in this way.
