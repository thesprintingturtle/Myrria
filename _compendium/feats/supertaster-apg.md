# Supertaster  *Feat 7*  
[general](general.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Perception](../skills.md#Perception)

You have refined your palate and have a discerning sense of taste that can detect abnormalities in the flavor and texture of food and beverages. When eating food or drinking a beverage, you automatically attempt to identify the ingredients, which might alert you to the presence of alterations or additives, such as poisons. The GM rolls a secret [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check using the poison's level to determine the DC; on a success, you learn that the food or drink was poisoned, but not the specific poison used.

If you lick or taste something while Investigating or attempting to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) to identify something, if the taste would provide relevant additional information (at the GM's discretion), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check.
