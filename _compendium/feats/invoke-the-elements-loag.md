# Invoke The Elements  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 9*  
[changeling](changeling-b1.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [primal](primal.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Brine May](brine-may-apg.md), [Snow May](snow-may-loag.md), [Veil May](veil-may-loag.md), or [Virga May](virga-may-loag.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You summon an aura of shimmering heat, flurrying snow, crashing waves, or swirling wind and lightning. For 1 minute, you gain concealment against creatures more than 5 feet away, and any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you suffers `1d12` damage (basic Reflex save using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher). At 13th and 17th level, this damage increases by `1d12`. A veil may changeling deals fire damage, a snow may changeling deals cold damage, a brine may changeling deals bludgeoning damage and the effect gains the [water](water.md) trait, and a virga may changeling deals electricity damage.

## Invoke The Elements leads to...
