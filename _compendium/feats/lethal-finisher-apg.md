# Lethal Finisher  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 18*  
[death](death.md)  [finisher](finisher-apg.md)  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: precise strike `6d6`
- **Activity** Single Action

You stab your foe in a vital organ, possibly killing them outright. Make a [Strike](strike.md). On a success, you forego your precise strike damage from the finisher. Instead, your target takes additional precision damage based on a Fortitude save against your class DC. If your [Strike](strike.md) was a critical hit, the target's saving throw outcome is one degree worse.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You deal 6 precision damage.
> - **Success** You deal `6d6` precision damage.
> - **Failure** You deal `12d6` precision damage.
> - **Critical Failure** You deal `18d6` precision damage.
