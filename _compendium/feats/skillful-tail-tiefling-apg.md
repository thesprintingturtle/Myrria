# Skillful Tail (Tiefling)  *Feat 5*  
[tiefling](tiefling-b1.md)  


You've always had a tail, but with practice, you've learned to use it for more than signaling your mood. You can perform simple [Interact](interact.md) actions with your tail such as opening an unlocked door. Your tail can't perform actions that require fingers or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish, and you can't use it to hold items.
