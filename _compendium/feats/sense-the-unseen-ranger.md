# Sense The Unseen (Ranger)  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 14*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Trigger** You fail a check to [Seek](seek.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

When you look for foes, you can catch even the slightest cues, such as their minute movements or the shifting of air currents on your skin. Even though you failed at the triggering check, you automatically sense any [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) creatures in the area where you're Seeking, making them merely [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to you.
