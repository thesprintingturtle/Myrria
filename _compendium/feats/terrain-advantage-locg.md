# Terrain Advantage  *Feat 9*  
[lizardfolk](lizardfolk-b1.md)  


You can take advantage of the terrain to bypass foes' defenses.

Non-lizardfolk creatures in difficult terrain are [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you. If you have a swim Speed, non-lizardfolk creatures that are in water and lack a swim Speed are also [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to you.
