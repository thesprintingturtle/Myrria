# Pinpoint Poisoner  *Feat 8*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


Unsuspecting targets are especially vulnerable to your poisons. When you successfully [Strike](strike.md) a [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature with a poisoned weapon or expose a [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) creature to an inhaled poison, the [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) condition also gives that creature a â€“2 circumstance penalty to its initial save against that poison.
