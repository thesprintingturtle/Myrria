# Blessed Denial  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Blessed One Dedication](blessed-one-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An ally within 30 feet would become [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened), [drained](conditions.md#Drained), [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled), [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened), or [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied).
- **Activity** Reaction

You exude peace and protection, lessening a harmful condition as it falls upon an ally. Reduce the value of the condition your ally would take by 1 (to a minimum of 0). If the ally takes more than one condition at the same time, choose one to reduce.
