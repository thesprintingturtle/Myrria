# Guiding Riposte  *Feat 14*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dueling Riposte](dueling-riposte.md)

By shifting your weight and angling your weapon, you guide your opponent to a more favorable position. When you use Dueling Riposte to [Strike](strike.md) and you hit, you can move the target up to 10 feet into a space in your reach. This follows the forced movement rules found on page 475.
