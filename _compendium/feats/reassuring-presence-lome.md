# Reassuring Presence  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[anadi](anadi-lome.md)  [auditory](auditory.md)  [visual](visual.md)  

- **Trigger** An ally within 30 feet gains the [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition.
- **Activity** Reaction

You serve as an anchor to your close companions, calming them in times of stress.

Decrease the value of the triggering ally's [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition by 1. The ally is then temporarily immune to your Reassuring Presence for 1 hour.
