# Dominating Gaze  *Feat 16*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Manipulative Charm](manipulative-charm-botd.md)

You stare into your target's eyes and enthrall them, shattering their free will. Once per day, you can cast 7th-level [dominate](../spells/dominate.md) as a divine innate spell, using your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher. It gains the [visual](visual.md) trait. At 18th level, the dominate is heightened to 8th level; at 20th level, it's heightened to 9th level. A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to your domination for 24 hours, though in most cases, you can't [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md) again within 24 hours. If you are destroyed, all your [dominate](../spells/dominate.md) spells from Dominating Gaze immediately end.
