# Tactical Cadence  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cadence Call](cadence-call-apg.md)

Your remarkable breath control and concise instructions allow you to coordinate your allies more effectively. When you grant allies the [quickened](conditions.md#Quickened) condition using Cadence Call, they can use the extra action to either [Stride](stride.md) or [Strike](strike.md), and they aren't [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) on their following turn if they use the extra action.
