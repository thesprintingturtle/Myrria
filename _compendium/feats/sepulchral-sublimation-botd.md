# Sepulchral Sublimation  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: ability to permanently create or control undead;  cleric with a negative font, oracle of bones, or necromancer wizard
- **Requirements**: You have at least one undead minion that you permanently control.
- **Activity** Single Action

You repurpose the negative energy that flows through your minions at a moment's notice. Instantly destroy one undead minion within 60 feet that is permanently under your control. If your next action is to cast a necromancy spell from a spell slot, you don't expend the slot. The spell's level must be half the destroyed minion's level or lower and the spell can't have a duration.

**Special.** This feat has the trait matching your spellcasting tradition.
