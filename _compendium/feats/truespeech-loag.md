# Truespeech  *Feat 13*  
[aasimar](aasimar-apg.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Angelkin](angelkin-apg.md)

It is paramount that you are understood and you understand others; language need not impede your message. You can cast [tongues](../spells/tongues.md) as a 5th-level divine innate spell once per day on yourself only. You gain a +1 status bonus to [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) checks for the duration of the spell when speaking to creatures with whom you already shared a language before casting.
