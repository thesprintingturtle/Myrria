# Sociable  *Feat 1*  
[half-elf](half-elf.md)  


You're extremely extroverted, and you often spend your time carousing or otherwise socializing. You are trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) (or another skill of your choice if you were already trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)), and you gain the [Hobnobber](hobnobber.md) skill feat.
