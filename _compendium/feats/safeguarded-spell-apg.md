# Safeguarded Spell  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You bring the magical wavelengths of your spell into sync with the ones produced by your own body. If the next action you take is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) with an area, you aren't affected by the spell even if you are within the area.
