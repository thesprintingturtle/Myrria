# Ten Lives  *Feat 17*  
[catfolk](catfolk-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Evade Doom](evade-doom-loag.md)

When your character would die, you can attempt a DC 17 flat check. On a success, you're instead reduced to 0 HP and a [dying](conditions.md#Dying) value 1 less than would normally kill you (typically [dying](conditions.md#Dying)). This doesn't change the result for any other creature affected.
