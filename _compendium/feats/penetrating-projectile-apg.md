# Penetrating Projectile  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 16*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a ranged or thrown weapon that deals piercing damage.
- **Activity** Two-Action

Your projectiles are unhindered by flesh and bone. Make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) against each creature in a 30-foot line. These attacks ignore lesser cover, cover, and greater cover granted by creatures. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty, but don't increase your penalty until you have made all your attacks.
