# Remember Your Training  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

During your training to become a Pathfinder Agent you were schooled on a wide variety of creatures you might encounter, and you can think back to that training to gain crucial insight in times of need. Attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) about a creature you can see, adding your level as a proficiency bonus if you are untrained (rather than 0)

If you roll a failure (but not a critical failure) on this check, you get a success instead.
