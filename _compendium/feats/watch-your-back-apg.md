# Watch Your Back  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[emotion](emotion.md)  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation)
- **Activity** Single Action

You menace the target, stoking their fears and drawing their attention. Attempt an [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check against the Will DC of a target within 30 feet. If you succeed, for 1 minute, that target gains a +2 status bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks against you, but they take a â€“2 status penalty to Will saves against [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effects.
