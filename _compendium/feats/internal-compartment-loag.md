# Internal Compartment  *Feat 1*  
[android](android-loag.md)  


You can hide a small object of up to light Bulk inside a hollow cavity on one of your forearms. It takes three [Interact](interact.md) actions to store an object in this way. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to the DCs of checks for others to [Seek](seek.md) or [Steal](steal.md) objects stored inside your arm. If you store a weapon in your arm, you can use a single action to [Interact](interact.md) to draw the weapon into the hand corresponding to your internal cavity, then [Strike](strike.md) with the weapon.
