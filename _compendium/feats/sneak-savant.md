# Sneak Savant  *Feat 10*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)

It is almost impossible to spot you without taking effort to look. When you roll a failure on a [Sneak](sneak.md) action, you get a success instead. You can still critically fail.
