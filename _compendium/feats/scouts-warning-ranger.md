# Scout's Warning (Ranger)  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Trigger** You are about to roll a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) or [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) check for initiative.
- **Activity** Free Action

You visually or audibly warn your allies of danger, granting them each a +1 circumstance bonus to their initiative rolls. Depending on whether you use gestures or call out, this action gains either the [visual](visual.md) or the [auditory](auditory.md) trait, respectively.
