# Buckler Dance  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[stance](stance.md)  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a buckler.
- **Activity** Single Action

You spin your buckler defensively toward every attack. While you are in this stance, you constantly have your buckler raised as if you'd used [Raise a Shield](raise-a-shield.md), as long as you meet that action's requirements.
