[lizardfolk](lizardfolk-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: cloudleaper lizardfolk heritage
- **Activity** Single Action

You glide slowly toward the ground, 5 feet down and up to 25 feet forward through the air. As long as you spend at least 1 action gliding each round and haven't yet reached the ground, you remain in the air at the end of your turn.
