# Dual Thrower  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dual-Weapon Warrior Dedication](dual-weapon-warrior-dedication-apg.md)

You know how to throw two weapons as easily as strike with them. Whenever a dual-weapon warrior feat allows you to make a melee [Strike](strike.md), you can instead make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) with a thrown weapon or a one-handed ranged weapon you are wielding. Any effects from these feats that apply to one-handed melee weapons or melee [Strikes](strike.md) also apply to one-handed ranged weapons and ranged [Strikes](strike.md).
