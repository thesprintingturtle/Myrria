# Everyone Duck!  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Trigger** You fail, but don't critically fail, an attempt to [Disable a Device](disable-a-device.md) on a trap.
- **Activity** Reaction

You intentionally set off the trap, but you take special precautions to protect yourself and your allies from the trap's effects. For the next 2 rounds, if the trap rolls a critical success on an attack roll, it gets a normal success instead, and if anyone rolls a critical failure on their saving throw against the trap, they get a normal failure instead.
