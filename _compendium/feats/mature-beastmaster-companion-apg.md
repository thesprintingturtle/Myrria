[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Beastmaster Dedication](beastmaster-dedication-apg.md)

All of your animal companions grow up, becoming mature animal companions and gaining additional capabilities (Core Rulebook 214). During an encounter, even if you don't use the [Command an Animal](command-an-animal.md) action, your animal companion can still use 1 action on your turn to either [Stride](stride.md) or [Strike](strike.md).

## Mature Beastmaster Companion leads to...

[Incredible Beastmaster Companion](incredible-beastmaster-companion-apg.md), [Specialized Beastmaster Companion](specialized-beastmaster-companion-apg.md), [Lead The Pack](lead-the-pack-apg.md)
