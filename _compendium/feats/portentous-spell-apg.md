- **Activity** Single Action

Your spellcasting is rife with strange lights, esoteric gestures, and other captivating effects that befuddle your foes. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md), any creature that attempts to use a reaction triggered by your [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) activity takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and skill checks rolled as part of the reaction. In addition, if the spell includes a spell attack roll or requires a saving throw, creatures you hit or that fail their saves are [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) with you until the start of your next turn.
