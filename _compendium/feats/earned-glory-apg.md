# Earned Glory  *Feat 1*  
[half-elf](half-elf.md)  


Elves are often skeptical of their half-elven kin, and you are experienced at telling stories of your accomplishments to gain their respect. You are trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance). If you would automatically become trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You gain the [Impressive Performance](impressive-performance.md) feat.

When you attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) on an elf, if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead.
