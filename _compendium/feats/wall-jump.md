# Wall Jump  *Feat 7*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: master in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)

You can use your momentum from a jump to propel yourself off a wall. If you're adjacent to a wall at the end of a jump (whether performing a [High Jump](high-jump.md), [Long Jump](long-jump.md), or [Leap](leap.md)), you don't fall as long as your next action is another jump.

Furthermore, since your previous jump gives you momentum, you can use [High Jump](high-jump.md) or [Long Jump](long-jump.md) as a single action, but you don't get to [Stride](stride.md) as part of the activity.

You can use Wall Jump only once in a turn, unless you're legendary in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics), in which case you can use Wall Jump as many times as you can use consecutive jump actions in that turn.

## Wall Jump leads to...
