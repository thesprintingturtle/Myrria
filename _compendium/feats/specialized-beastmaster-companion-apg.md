# Specialized Beastmaster Companion  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Incredible Beastmaster Companion](incredible-beastmaster-companion-apg.md)

Your nimble and savage animal companions become cunning enough to become specialized. Each companion gains one specialization of your choice (Core Rulebook 217, choose separately).

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, add a different specialization to your nimble and savage companions. Your nimble and savage companions can have up to three specializations each.
