# Divine Disharmony  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*

- **Activity** Single Action

From your collection of religious trinkets, you pull out opposing divine objects—such as the religious symbols of two deities that are hated enemies—and combine them in a display that causes discordant clashes of divine energy that are especially distracting to the faithful. Roll your choice of a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) or [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check against the Will DC of a creature you can see within 60 feet, with the following results. If the creature is particularly devoted to a deity, such as a cleric, celestial, monitor, fiend, or other creature with divine spells, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill check. The GM might determine that a creature that despises all deities, such as an alghollthu, is unaffected.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) to your attacks until the end of your next turn.
> - **Success** The creature is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against your attacks until the end of your current turn.
