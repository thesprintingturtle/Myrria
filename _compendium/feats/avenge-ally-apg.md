# Avenge Ally  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 13*  
[elf](elf.md)  [fortune](fortune.md)  

- **Frequency**: once every 10 minutes
- **Requirements**: You are adjacent to an ally with the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition.
- **Activity** Single Action

Though you know that you will eventually outlive your companions, seeing them at death's door brings clarity to your attacks. Make a [Strike](strike.md). Roll twice on the attack roll and use the higher result.
