[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting)

Your knowledge of items' construction allows you to discern their [magical](magical.md) effects as well. You can use [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting) instead of a skill associated with a magic tradition to [Identify Magic](identify-magic.md) on magic items, though not on any other sorts of magic.
