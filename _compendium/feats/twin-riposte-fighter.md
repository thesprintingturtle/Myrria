# Twin Riposte (Fighter)  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 10*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Trigger** A creature within your reach critically fails a [Strike](strike.md) against you.
- **Requirements**: You are benefiting from [Twin Parry](twin-parry-fighter.md).
- **Activity** Reaction

A clever parry with one weapon leaves your opponent open to an attack with the other weapon. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) or use a [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) action against the triggering opponent.
