# Straveika  *Feat 1*  
[dhampir](dhampir-b1.md)  [lineage](lineage-apg.md)  


You descend from one of the truly ancient vampires, a nosferatu cursed to eternal life but not eternal youth. People call you straveika, or ancient-born. The vestiges of your forebear's powers of domination have left you with an understanding of how a creature's intentions change its behaviors. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Sense Motive](sense-motive.md) and [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) DCs against attempts to [Lie](lie.md) to you.

## Straveika leads to...

[Taste Blood](taste-blood-loag.md)
