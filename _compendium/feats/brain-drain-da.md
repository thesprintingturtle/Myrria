# Brain Drain  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[divination](divination.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [occult](occult.md)  [psyche](psyche-da.md)  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

With a wresting of will, you siphon off a creature's mental energy to replenish your own. One non-mindless creature within 30 feet must attempt a Will save against your spell DC.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 minute, and you regain 1 Focus Point, up to your normal maximum. You can't use Brain Drain again until after the next time you make your daily preparations.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature is [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied).
