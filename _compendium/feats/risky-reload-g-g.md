# Risky Reload  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 2*  
[flourish](flourish.md)  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a firearm.
- **Activity** Single Action

You've practiced a technique for rapidly reloading your firearm, but attempting to use this technique is a dangerous gamble with your firearm's functionality. [Interact](interact.md) to reload a firearm, then make a [Strike](strike.md) with that firearm. If the [Strike](strike.md) fails, the firearm misfires.
