# Rat Magic  *Feat 5*  
[ratfolk](ratfolk-b1.md)  


There always seems to be a little rat around to carry messages for you. You can cast [animal messenger](../spells/animal-messenger.md) once per day as a primal innate spell. When you do, the animal that responds is always a rat. If there are no rats within range, the spell is lost.
