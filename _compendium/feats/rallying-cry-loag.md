[auditory](auditory.md)  [hobgoblin](hobgoblin-locg.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You call out to your allies and push them to give their all in combat. All allies within 30 feet that can hear you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level. In addition, these allies become [quickened](conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 minute but can only use the extra action to [Step](step.md), [Stride](stride.md), or [Strike](strike.md).
