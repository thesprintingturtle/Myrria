# Sink and Swim  *Feat 14*  
[aftermath](aftermath-da.md)  [rare](rare.md)  [water](water.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: You've been brought to 0 Hit Points by an enemy that has the [water](water.md) trait or an enemy's ability that has the [water](water.md) trait.

Your body looks like it's made of flowing water, clear and pristine, providing a natural grace to all your movements. You gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed. If you already had a swim Speed, it's increased by 10 feet. You gain the Water Transfer activity, which enables you to teleport through a body of water.
