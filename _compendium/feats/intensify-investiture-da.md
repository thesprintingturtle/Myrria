[thaumaturge](rules/traits/thaumaturge-da.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Activity** Free Action

Your bond to your invested items enables you to put more of yourself into them. If you next action is to activate an invested item that has a saving throw DC, you can use your thaumaturge class DC instead of the item's DC if it is higher.
