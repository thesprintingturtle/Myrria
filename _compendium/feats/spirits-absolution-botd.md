# Spirit's Absolution  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [healing](healing.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [positive](positive.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Exorcist Dedication](exorcist-dedication-botd.md)
- **Cost**: 1 spirit wisp or spirit remnant from your spirit dwelling
- **Requirements**: You are holding your spirit dwelling.
- **Activity** Single Action

You purify a spirit by absolving it of its sins and regrets. This cathartic experience restores your Hit Points or those of an adjacent ally. If you expend a spirit wisp, the target recovers `1d4` Hit Points per level you have. If you expend a spirit remnant, the target recovers `1d6` Hit Points per level of the incorporeal undead or haunt from which you gained the remnant.
