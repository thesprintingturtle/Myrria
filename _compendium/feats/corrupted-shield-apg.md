# Corrupted Shield  *Feat 6*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [divine](divine.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [negative](negative.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: divine ally (shield), tenets of evil

Your shield ally is more than just a spirit of protectionâ€” it's a conduit for deadly divine magic. When you use your shield ally to [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) a melee unarmed attack or a melee weapon [Strike](strike.md) from an adjacent creature, the attacker takes `1d6` evil or negative damage (your choice). If the attack or [Strike](strike.md) breaks or destroys your shield, double this additional damage.

The damage the attacker takes increases to `2d6` at 11th level and `3d6` at 16th level.
