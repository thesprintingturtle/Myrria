[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)

When you [Aid](aid.md) an ally who is trying to [Create a Diversion](create-a-diversion.md), instead of the usual effects of [Aid](aid.md), you can roll a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check and use that result to determine the outcome of the diversion, instead of the ally rolling a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check.
