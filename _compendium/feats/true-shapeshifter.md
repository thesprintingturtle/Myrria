# True Shapeshifter  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 20*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Shape](dragon-shape.md), [Wild Shape](wild-shape.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You transcend the limitations of form. While under the effects of wild shape, you can change into any other form on your wild shape list; if the durations of the forms would vary, use the shorter of the two durations.

Once per day, you can transform into a kaiju, with the effects of [nature incarnate](../spells/nature-incarnate.md); if you have [Plant Shape](plant-shape.md), you can instead transform into a green man.
