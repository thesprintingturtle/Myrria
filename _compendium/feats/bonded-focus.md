# Bonded Focus  *Feat 14*  
[wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: arcane bond

Your connection to your bonded item increases your focus pool. If you have spent at least 2 Focus Points since the last time you [Refocused](refocus.md) and your bonded item is in your possession, you recover 2 Focus Points when you [Refocus](refocus.md) instead of 1.
