# Celestial Form  *Feat 18*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

You take on a celestial countenance, appearing like a type of celestial who serves your deity; for example, as an angel, you would gain a halo and feathery wings. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. You gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) if you don't already have it, and you gain the [celestial](celestial.md) trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor you've become ([archon](archon.md), [angel](angel.md), or [azata](azata.md), for example).
