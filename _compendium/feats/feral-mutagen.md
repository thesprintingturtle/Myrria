# Feral Mutagen  *Feat 8*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  


Your bestial mutagen brings out the beast lurking within you, granting you especially sharp claws and teeth as well as a ferocious appearance. Whenever you're affected by a bestial mutagen, you gain the mutagen's item bonus to your [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) checks. In addition, your claws and jaws are increasingly vicious, and they gain the [deadly <d10>](deadly.md) trait. Finally, you can increase the mutagen's penalty to AC from –1 to –2 and, in exchange, increase the damage die size of your claws and jaws by one step.
