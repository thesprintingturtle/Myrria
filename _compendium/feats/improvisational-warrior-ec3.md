# Improvisational Warrior  *Feat 9*  
[shoony](shoony-ec3.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Improvisational Defender

When you use an improvised weapon, you apply the critical specialization of a brawling weapon to it.

Depending on the shape and nature of the improvised weapon, your GM might determine another weapon group's critical specialization is more appropriate.
