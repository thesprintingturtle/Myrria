# Replicate  *Feat 5*  
[reflection](reflection-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Clone-Risen](clone-risen-da.md)

You've learned to reshape your malleable form. You can cast [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md) once per day as an innate occult spell. This is a [transmutation](transmutation.md) and [morph](morph.md) effect, as your body physically transforms, rather than an [illusion](illusion.md) effect.
