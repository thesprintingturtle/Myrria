# Stab And Blast  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[flourish](flourish.md)  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're wielding a firearm with an attached bayonet or reinforced stock, a fire lance, or a combination weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You slice or smash your opponent with the melee portion of your weapon before pulling the trigger at point-blank range.

Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) with the required weapon. If the [Strike](strike.md) is successful, you can immediately make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) against the same target with a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. This counts as two attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making both attacks.
