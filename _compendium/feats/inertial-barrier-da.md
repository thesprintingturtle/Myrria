# Inertial Barrier  *Feat 6*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [amp](amp-da.md)  [occult](occult.md)  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  


Your spell leaves behind barriers that reduce shock and motion.

Use this amp in place of a psi cantrip's normal amp entry. Amp You or one target of the spell gains resistance to physical damage equal to 2 + the spell's level until the start of your next turn.
