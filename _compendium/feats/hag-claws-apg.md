# Hag Claws  *Feat 1*  
[changeling](changeling-b1.md)  


When you came of age, your fingernails grew long and sharp.

You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals `1d4` slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile, [finesse](finesse.md), and [unarmed](unarmed.md) traits.

**Special.** Hag claws can develop at any point in a changeling's life, allowing you to select this feat anytime you would gain an ancestry feat, but once you've selected it, you can't retrain out of it.
