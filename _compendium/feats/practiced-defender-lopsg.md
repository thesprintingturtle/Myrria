# Practiced Defender  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](swordmaster-dedication-locg.md)

After extensive practice with the Swords, you're comfortable enough with your shield to move at a normal pace with it raised. You may use the [Defend](defend.md) exploration activity while traveling at your full travel speed instead of half your travel speed.
