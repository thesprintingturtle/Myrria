[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](stance.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a tight stance, coiled up like a lashing cobra with your hands poised as venomous fangs. While in this stance, the only [Strikes](strike.md) you can make are cobra fang unarmed attacks.

These deal `1d4` poison damage; are in the brawling group; and have the [agile](agile.md), [deadly <d10>](deadly.md), [finesse](finesse.md), [nonlethal](nonlethal.md), [poison](rules/traits/poison.md), and [unarmed](unarmed.md) traits.

While in Cobra Stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves and your Fortitude DC, and you gain poison resistance equal to half your level.

## Cobra Stance leads to...
