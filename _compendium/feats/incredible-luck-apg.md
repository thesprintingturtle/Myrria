# Incredible Luck  *Feat 18*  
[fortune](fortune.md)  [swashbuckler](rules/traits/swashbuckler-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Charmed Life](charmed-life-apg.md)

You always seem to bounce back from the worst. When you use Charmed Life, roll the save twice (including the +2 circumstance bonus from Charmed Life) and use the better result.
