# Tide-hardened  *Feat 1*  
[undine](undine-b2.md)  


You're at home in the unpredictable tides. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against [cold](cold.md) and [water](water.md) effects. If you roll a success on a save against a [cold](cold.md) or [water](water.md) effect, you get a critical success instead.
