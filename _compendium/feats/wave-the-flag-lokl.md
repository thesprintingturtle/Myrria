# Wave the Flag  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [emotion](emotion.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  [visual](visual.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cavalier's Banner](cavaliers-banner-apg.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You wave your banner, inspiring allies to throw off the shackles of fear. Each ally presently benefiting from your Cavalier's Banner feat reduces their current [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition by 1 and can choose to immediately attempt a new saving throw against any one [mental](mental.md) effect currently affecting them. Regardless of the result, any ally that attempts a save is temporarily immune to Wave the Flag for 10 minutes.
