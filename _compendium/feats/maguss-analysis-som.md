# Magus's Analysis  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spellstrike](spellstrike-som.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You make an assessment informed by your knowledge of how a creature fights. Attempt a check to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) about a creature. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check if you previously hit the creature with a [Strike](strike.md) this turn. If your check is successful, recharge your [Spellstrike](spellstrike-som.md). The subject of your check is temporarily immune to Magus's Analysis for 1 day.
