[nagaji](nagaji-loil.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Activity** Single Action

Your people's ancient and storied rivalry with garudas led you to develop special techniques against flying foes. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against a flying creature up to one size larger than you; if you hit, you use your neck or coils to smash the creature into the ground. In addition to the normal effects of your [Strike](strike.md), the creature moves to the nearest unoccupied ground space adjacent to you and can't [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), levitate, or otherwise leave the ground for 1 round. On a critical hit, it can't [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), levitate, or otherwise leave the ground for 1 minute.
