# Fell Rider  *Feat 9*  
[hobgoblin](hobgoblin-locg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: animal companion

You have trained with your animal companion to become a terrifying, unified juggernaut on the battlefield. Your animal companion becomes trained in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation). If your animal companion uses Support while serving as your mount, it grants you the effects of the [Aid](aid.md) reaction on your first [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) check to [Demoralize](demoralize.md) on the same turn, even though it can't take reactions.
