# Drive Back  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Bastion Dedication](bastion-dedication-apg.md)
- **Trigger** An enemy within your reach [Strikes](strike.md) an ally adjacent to you.
- **Requirements**: You have your shield raised.
- **Activity** Reaction

You push the enemy back and attempt to intercede between the foe and your ally. You attempt to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) the triggering enemy with your shield just as it attacks, pushing it back just after the attempt. Your shield has the [shove](rules/traits/shove.md) trait for this [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) attempt. If the [shove](rules/actions/shove.md) succeeds, you throw off your enemy's timing, and the enemy takes a â€“1 circumstance penalty on its attack roll against your ally.
