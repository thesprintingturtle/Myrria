# Bone Swarm  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 17*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [polymorph](polymorph.md)  [skeleton](skeleton-b1.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Two-Action

You scatter your body and transform into a whirling storm of bones for up to 1 minute or until you spend a single action to return to your normal shape. You become Huge, gain the [swarm](swarm-b1.md) trait, and gain a fly Speed of 40 feet. As a swarm, you have the following characteristics.

- You are immune to the grappled, [prone](conditions.md#Prone), and [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) conditions.
- You have weakness 5 to area and splash damage.
- You can occupy the same space as other creatures and must do so to use your damaging ability.
- As a 2-action activity, you can deal `10d6` bludgeoning damage to all creatures sharing your space (basic Reflex save with a DC equal to your class DC or spell DC, whichever is higher).
- You can't speak, Cast Spells, use manipulate actions requiring your hands, Activate magic items, or make any [Strikes](strike.md) with your normal body.
- You don't gain the swarm mind ability, so you are still affected normally by [mental](mental.md) effects. You also retain the benefits of skeleton feats that don't require communication or the use of hands.
