# Storm Shroud  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [conjuration](conjuration.md)  [divine](divine.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](mummy-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Two-Action

You become surrounded by a swirling storm of rain, sand, snow, or clouds, whichever of those suits your bound terrain. This activity has traits appropriate to the storm you createâ€” typically [earth](earth.md) for sand and [water](water.md) for rain, snow, or clouds. You become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) for 1 minute. You can't use this concealment to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](sneak.md), as normal for concealment that makes your position obvious.
