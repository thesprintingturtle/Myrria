# Sabotage  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 4*  
[incapacitation](incapacitation.md)  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have a free hand.
- **Activity** Single Action

You subtly damage others' equipment. Choose one item that a creature within your reach wields or carries. The item must have moving parts that you could possibly sabotage (a [shortbow](../equipment/items/shortbow.md) could be sabotaged, but a [longsword](../equipment/items/longsword.md) could not). Attempt a [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check against the Reflex DC of the creature. Damage dealt by Sabotage can't take the item below its Break Threshold.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You deal damage equal to four times your [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) proficiency bonus.
> - **Success** You deal damage equal to double your [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) proficiency bonus.
> - **Critical Failure** Temporarily immune to your Sabotage for 1 day.
