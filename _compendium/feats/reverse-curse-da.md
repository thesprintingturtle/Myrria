# Reverse Curse  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Counter Curse

When you counter a [curse](curse.md) or [misfortune](misfortune.md) effect, you send it back to destroy its originator. Whenever you succeed at the counteract check to Counter Curse, the creature is affected by its own [curse](curse.md) or [misfortune](misfortune.md) effect, attempting a saving throw against its own DC if the effect allows a saving throw.

In the case of a constant ability, such as a misfortune aura, the creature is affected only until the beginning of its next turn, when the ability reasserts itself.
