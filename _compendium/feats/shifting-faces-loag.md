# Shifting Faces  *Feat 5*  
[kitsune](kitsune-loag.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tailless alternate form
- **Frequency**: once per day

You wear many faces, even those that don't belong to you. When you Change Shape into your tailless form, you gain the effects of 3rd-level [illusory disguise](../spells/illusory-disguise.md) for 1 hour or until you shift back, except it's a [transmutation](transmutation.md) effect rather than an illusion.
