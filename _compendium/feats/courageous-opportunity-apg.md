- **Requirements**: You are affected by [inspire courage](../spells/inspire-courage.md).

You bellow a ferocious call to arms, inspiring yourself to lash out at a foe. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a [manipulate](manipulate.md) action, the action is disrupted.
