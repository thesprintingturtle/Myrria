# Fearsome Brute  *Feat 10*  
[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  


Fear makes your foes weak and more vulnerable to your attacks. You gain a circumstance bonus to damage rolls for [Strikes](strike.md) against [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creatures. The bonus is equal to double the target's [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) value. If you have master proficiency in [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation), increase the bonus to triple the target's [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) value.
