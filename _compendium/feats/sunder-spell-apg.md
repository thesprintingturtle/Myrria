# Sunder Spell  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[attack](attack.md)  [barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: superstition instinct
- **Activity** Two-Action

You draw upon your superstitious fury to destroy a spell. Make a [Strike](strike.md) with a melee weapon or an unarmed attack against a creature, object, or a spell manifestation (such as the wall created by [wall of fire](../spells/wall-of-fire.md) or the guardian from [spiritual guardian](../spells/spiritual-guardian.md)). If you're targeting something that doesn't have an AC listed, its AC is usually 10 against this Strike for targets that are very easy to hit, like a wall, or a different AC determined by the GM.

If your [Strike](strike.md) hits, you can attempt to counteract a single spell or [magical](magical.md) effect on the target. Your counteract level for this attempt is equal to half your level rounded up, and you use the result of your attack roll for the counteract check.

Whether or not you succeed at your [Strike](strike.md), the target becomes temporarily immune to your Sunder Spell for 24 hours.
