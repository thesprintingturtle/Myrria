# Pitborn  *Feat 1*  
[lineage](lineage-apg.md)  [tiefling](tiefling-b1.md)  


Your blood bears the mark of a [demon](demon.md), a living embodiment of sin from the fetid depths of the Abyss. Demonic power pulses through your veins and manifests in a different way for each pitborn, whether you have webbed fingers and thrive in the water, large hands capable of wrestling larger foes, or some other manifestation. You are trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics). If you were already trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

You also gain any one common 1st-level skill feat with a prerequisite of trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics), as reflects the manifestation of your Abyssal blood.

## Pitborn leads to...
