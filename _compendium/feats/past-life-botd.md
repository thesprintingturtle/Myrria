# Past Life  *Feat 5*  
[skeleton](skeleton-b1.md)  


Flashes of your life become clearer and more frequent, allowing you to apply skills you developed while alive. You become trained in a skill of your choice and gain the [Additional Lore](additional-lore.md) feat for a [Lore](../skills.md#Lore) subcategory tied to your life.
