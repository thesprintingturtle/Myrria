# Martyr  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: divine font
- **Activity** Single Action

You go to extreme lengths to support your allies, even when it means bringing harm to yourself. If your next action is to cast [harm](../spells/harm.md) or [heal](../spells/heal.md) from your healing or harmful font to restore Hit Points to a single ally, you can channel your own vitality along with the spell. You lose `1d8` Hit Points per level of the spell, which can't be reduced or mitigated in any way, and your ally regains an equal number of Hit Points.
