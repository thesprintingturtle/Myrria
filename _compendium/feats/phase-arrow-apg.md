# Phase Arrow  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [conjuration](conjuration.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Eldritch Archer Dedication](eldritch-archer-dedication-apg.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Single Action

You can concentrate an immense amount of magic to create a piece of ammunition that phases through everything but your target. Make a bow [Strike](strike.md) against a foe who is [observed](conditions.md#Observed) or [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to you (but not [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected)). The ammunition travels to your target in a straight line, passing through any non-magical barriers or walls in its way, though magical barriers stop the arrow. The shot ignores all cover, the [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition, the [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) condition, and circumstance bonuses to AC from shields. It has a +4 status bonus to hit creatures wearing any type of armor. The [Strike](strike.md)'s damage can't be reduced with a [Shield Block](compendium/feats/shield-block.md) reaction using a non-magical shield.
