# Opportune Throw  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 16*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance), [Juggler Dedication](juggler-dedication-ec1.md)
- **Trigger** A creature within 10 feet of you uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Requirements**: You are Juggling a thrown weapon.
- **Activity** Reaction

You make a thrown ranged [Strike](strike.md) with the required weapon against the triggering creature. If you critically succeed and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action.

This [Strike](strike.md) doesn't count against your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this [Strike](strike.md).
