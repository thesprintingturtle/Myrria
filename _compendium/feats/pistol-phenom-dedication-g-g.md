# Pistol Phenom Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [dedication](dedication.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm, trained in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance)

You catch an opponent off-guard by spinning your weapon.

You gain the [Pistol Twirl](pistol-twirl-g-g.md) gunslinger feat, enabling you to [Feint](feint.md) against creatures within your weapon's first range increment.

This otherwise serves as Pistol Twirl for the purpose of meeting prerequisites, although as normal, it doesn't count as another pistol phenom feat for the purpose of meeting Pistol Phenom Dedication's special entry and taking another archetype. Whenever you [Feint](feint.md) with a one-handed firearm, you can choose to attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check instead of a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained at least two other feats from the pistol phenom archetype.

## Pistol Phenom Dedication leads to...

[Dazzling Bullet](dazzling-bullet-g-g.md), [Gunpowder Gauntlet](gunpowder-gauntlet-g-g.md), [Hot Foot](hot-foot-g-g.md), [Phenom's Verve](phenoms-verve-g-g.md), [Reach For The Sky](reach-for-the-sky-g-g.md), [Whirling Knockdown](whirling-knockdown-g-g.md)
