# Discordant Voice  *Feat 18*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [sonic](sonic.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [inspire courage](../spells/inspire-courage.md)

Your inspire courage lets loose a discordant shriek that imbues your allies' attacks with powerful sonic reverberations. While your allies are affected by your inspire courage, their weapon [Strikes](strike.md) and unarmed attacks deal an additional `1d6` sonic damage.
