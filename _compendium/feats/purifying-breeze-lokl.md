# Purifying Breeze  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Prerequisites**: divine spells
- **Requirements**: Your most recent action was to cast a non-cantrip spell with the [healing](healing.md) trait.
- **Activity** Single Action

You transfer the divine essence of your magic to the air around you, cleansing it of toxins. Attempt a counteract check against each airborne [disease](rules/traits/disease.md) or [poison](rules/traits/poison.md) effect in a 15-foot radius around you. Regardless of your success or failure, until the beginning of your next turn, all creatures in the purified area gain a +1 status bonus to Fortitude saving throws.
