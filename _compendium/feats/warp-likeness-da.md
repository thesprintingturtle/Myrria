[morph](morph.md)  [occult](occult.md)  [reflection](reflection-da.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Morph-Risen](morph-risen-da.md)
- **Frequency**: once per minute
- **Requirements**: You hit a creature with a melee [Strike](strike.md) on your last action.
- **Activity** Single Action

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target resists the effect but its form twists in the process. It's [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) until the end of its next turn.
> - **Failure** The target's body briefly warps to resemble yours. It's [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) until the end of its next turn and [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened).
> - **Critical Failure** The target's body warps to resemble yours for a significant time. It's [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 minute and [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened).
