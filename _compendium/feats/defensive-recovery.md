- **Prerequisites**: harmful font or healing font

Your faith provides temporary protection in addition to healing. If the next action you use is to cast [harm](../spells/harm.md) or [heal](../spells/heal.md) on a single target and the target regains Hit Points from the spell, it also gains a +2 status bonus to AC and saving throws for 1 round.
