# Scour the Library  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[psyche](psyche-da.md)  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Requirements**: gathered lore subconscious mind
- **Activity** Single Action

Seeing an enemy's attack, you quickly consult multiple scraps of lore in your mind, synthesizing them into the perfect plan.

Make a check to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) (using an appropriate skill) about one creature within 60 feet. On a success, in addition to the normal benefits, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that creature and to your AC against the creature's next attack. On a critical success, the bonuses are +2.
