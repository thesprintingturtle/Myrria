[human](human.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** You lose the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition.
- **Activity** Free Action

You recover from near-death experiences with astounding resilience. Don't increase the value of your [wounded](conditions.md#Wounded) condition due to losing the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition.
