# Ceaseless Shadows  *Feat 13*  
[halfling](halfling.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Distracting Shadows](distracting-shadows.md)

You excel at going unnoticed, especially among a crowd. You no longer need to have cover or be [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](sneak.md). If you would have lesser cover from creatures, you gain cover and can [Take Cover](take-cover.md), and if you would have cover from creatures, you gain greater cover.
