# Shape of the Cloud Dragon  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dragon Disciple Dedication](dragon-disciple-dedication-apg.md)

You've discovered how to transform yourself into a cloud dragon. Once per day, you can cast 7th-level [dragon form](../spells/dragon-form.md) as an innate arcane spell, transforming into a cloud dragon. The spell automatically heightens to 8th level if you're 16th level and 9th level if you're 18th level. On a critical hit with an unarmed [Strike](strike.md) gained from dragon form, you recharge the spell's breath weapon immediately.

While in this form, you gain the following cloud dragonâ€“specific abilities:

- **Cloud** cloud walk (you can walk on clouds or fog); **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws, **Damage** `2d10` piercing plus `1d12` electricity; **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") claw ([agile](agile.md)), **Damage** `3d10` slashing; **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") tail ([reach <10 feet>](reach.md)), **Damage** `3d10` bludgeoning; **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") horn ([reach <10 feet>](reach.md)), **Damage** `3d8` piercing; breath weapon 30-foot cone, `6d12` electricity.

**Special.** You can use this feat in place of [Shape of the Dragon](shape-of-the-dragon-apg.md) to fulfill feat requirements.
