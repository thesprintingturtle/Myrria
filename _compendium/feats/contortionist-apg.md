# Contortionist  *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Acrobat Dedication](acrobat-dedication-apg.md)

You can squeeze out of tight situations surprisingly quickly, gaining an advantage against foes that try to pin you down.

You gain the [Quick Squeeze](quick-squeeze.md) skill feat, and if you're a master in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), you can [Squeeze](squeeze.md) at full Speed. Whenever you successfully [Escape](escape.md) using [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), the creature you [Escaped](escape.md) from is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next attack you make against it before the end of your next turn.
