# Telluric Power  *Feat 13*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md)  


You channel strength from the earth beneath your feet to pummel your enemies. When making a melee [Strike](strike.md) against a target who is standing on the same earth or stone surface as you are, you gain a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the number of weapon damage dice.
