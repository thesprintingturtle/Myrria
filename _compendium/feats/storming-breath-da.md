# Storming Breath  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 6*  
[deviant](deviant-da.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [rare](rare.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You spit out a freezing breath or sonic scream. You deal `4d6` damage, plus `1d6` damage for every level you have beyond 6th, to all creatures in a 30-foot cone, with a basic Reflex save.

**Awakening** Your blast powerfully batters your foes. A creature that critically fails its save is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone).

**Awakening** The kickback of your blast helps you make a speedy escape. When you use this ability, you [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) backward 15 feet in a straight line directly opposite your blast. This movement doesn't trigger reactions based on movement.
