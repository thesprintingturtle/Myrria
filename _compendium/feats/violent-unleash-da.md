# Violent Unleash  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 4*  
[evocation](evocation.md)  [mindshift](mindshift-da.md)  [occult](occult.md)  [psychic](rules/traits/psychic-da.md)  

- **Trigger** You [Unleash your Psyche](unleash-psyche-da.md).
- **Activity** Free Action

The force of your mind unleashing itself wracks your enemies with a violent shockwave. You deal `2d6` force damage to all creatures in a 20-foot emanation, with a basic Reflex save. This explosion is taxing, making you [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).

At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by `1d6`.
