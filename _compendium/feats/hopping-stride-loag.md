# Hopping Stride  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 5*  
[dhampir](dhampir-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Ru-Shi](ru-shi-loag.md)
- **Activity** Single Action

You've internalized the hopping gait of your vampiric forebear. [Stride](stride.md) up to a distance equal to your Speed â€“ 10 feet. During this [Stride](stride.md), instead of moving through each space normally, you hop over every other square between your starting space and your ending space. These hops aren't high enough to jump over a creature or other significant obstacle in your way, but they avoid difficult terrain, hazardous terrain, pressure plates, or hazards on the ground or up to a foot above it in the spaces you hopped over.
