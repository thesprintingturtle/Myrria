[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Viking Dedication](viking-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) with a thrown weapon you already have in your hand, [Stride](stride.md), and then [Interact](interact.md) to draw another weapon. If you are [raging](rules/actions/rage.md), you can add the additional damage with melee weapons you receive from [raging](rules/actions/rage.md) to your damage with the thrown weapon.
