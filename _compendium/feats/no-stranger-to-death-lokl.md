# No Stranger to Death  *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lastwall Sentry Dedication](lastwall-sentry-dedication-lowg.md)

Your regular exposure to the insidious putrescence of undeath inured you to its effects. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws made against spells and effects with the death, [disease](rules/traits/disease.md), and [evil](evil.md) traits. Whenever you become [drained](conditions.md#Drained) or [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened), reduce the status penalty you take from the condition by 1, to a minimum of 0.
