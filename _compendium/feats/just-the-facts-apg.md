# Just The Facts  *Feat 20*  
[investigator](rules/traits/investigator-apg.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Thorough Research](thorough-research-apg.md)

You fundamentally understand everything to the point where your research can't possibly be wrong. You are permanently [quickened](conditions.md#Quickened) and can use the extra action to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md).

Your checks to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) are no longer secret.

When you [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md), you use the outcome for one degree of success better than the result of your check, and if an effect (such as [Dubious Knowledge](dubious-knowledge.md)) would give you inaccurate information from your [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) check, you know which information is inaccurate. When one of your allies [Recalls Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) and gains false information, you also know that information is inaccurate if they share it with you.
