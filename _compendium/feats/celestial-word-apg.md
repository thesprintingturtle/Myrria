# Celestial Word  *Feat 17*  
[aasimar](aasimar-apg.md)  


You can call forth a holy word from the celestial realms to punish your foes. Once per day, you can cast [divine decree](../spells/divine-decree.md) as a 7th-level divine innate spell. You must choose good for the spell's alignment, and you can [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md) regardless of whether you worship a deity or what their alignment is.
