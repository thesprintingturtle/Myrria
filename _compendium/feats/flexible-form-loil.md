# Flexible Form  *Feat 1*  
[ghoran](ghoran-loil.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: any heritage except strong oak

Your body is as supple as a sapling, capable of bending without breaking.

You become trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), and if you roll a success to [Squeeze](squeeze.md), you get a critical success instead. If you would automatically become trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.
