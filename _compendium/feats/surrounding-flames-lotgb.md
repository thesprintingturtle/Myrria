[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Spell Trickster Dedication](spell-trickster-dedication-lotgb.md), ability to cast [wall of fire](../spells/wall-of-fire.md)

When you cast [wall of fire](../spells/wall-of-fire.md), you can modify its standard effects as follows: Instead of a 5-foot-thick, 10-foot-radius ring of flame, you can form the wall into a 10-foot-radius hemisphere of fire.
