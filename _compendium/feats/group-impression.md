# Group Impression  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)

When you [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md), you can compare your [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check result to the Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It's possible to get a different degree of success for each target. The number of targets increases to four if you're an expert, 10 if you're a master, and 25 if you're legendary.
