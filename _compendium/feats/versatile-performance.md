# Versatile Performance  *Feat 1*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Polymath muse

You can rely on the grandeur of your performances rather than ordinary social skills. You can use [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) instead of [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) and instead of [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation) to [Demoralize](demoralize.md). You can also use an acting [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) instead of [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) to [Impersonate](impersonate.md). You can use your proficiency rank in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) to meet the requirements of skill feats that require a particular rank in [Deception](../skills.md#Deception), [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy), or [Intimidation](../skills.md#Intimidation).
