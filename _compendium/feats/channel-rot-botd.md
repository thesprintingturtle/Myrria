# Channel Rot  *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Accursed Touch](accursed-touch-botd.md)

You've learned to channel your curse through weapons you wield instead of solely through your flesh. The benefits of Accursed Touch apply to any melee weapon you wield instead of only your fist [Strikes](strike.md).
