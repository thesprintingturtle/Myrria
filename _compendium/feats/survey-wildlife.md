# Survey Wildlife  *Feat 1*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)

You can study details in the wilderness to determine the presence of nearby creatures. You can spend 10 minutes assessing the area around you to find out what creatures are nearby, based on nests, scat, and marks on vegetation. Attempt a [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) check against a DC determined by the GM based on how obvious the signs are. On a success, you can attempt a [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) check with a â€“2 penalty to learn more about the creatures just from these signs. If you're a master in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival), you don't take the penalty.
