# Brightsoul  *Feat 1*  
[ifrit](ifrit-b2.md)  [lineage](lineage-apg.md)  


The fire inside you asserts itself as beaming, radiant light. Your body is naturally luminescent, glowing with the effects of a primal [light](../spells/light.md) cantrip. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. The light is involuntary and constant; if counteracted, it returns in `1d4` rounds. You suffer a â€“2 circumstance penalty on [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) or [Sneak](sneak.md) and gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against [light](rules/traits/light.md) effects and effects that inflict the [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) or [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) conditions.
