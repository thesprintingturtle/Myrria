[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics), [Firebrand Braggart Dedication](firebrand-braggart-dedication-locg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You attempt a death-defying maneuver to distract your enemies. Select one foe within reach and attempt either an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check against your target's Reflex DC. If you succeed, you can [Stride](stride.md) up to half your Speed (or up to your full Speed if you critically succeed) without triggering reactions from the target due to your movement, and the target is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the next melee attack you attempt against it before the end of your turn.

## Daring Act leads to...

[Daredevil's Gambit](daredevils-gambit-locg.md), [Daring Flourish](daring-flourish-locg.md)
