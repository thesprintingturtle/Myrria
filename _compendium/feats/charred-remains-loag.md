# Charred Remains  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 9*  
[fire](fire.md)  [ifrit](ifrit-b2.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Activity** Free Action

Your next fire spell leaves embers in its wake. If your next action is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) with an area and the [fire](fire.md) trait, for 1 minute, your spell's area becomes difficult terrain as well as hazardous terrain, dealing 1 fire damage for each square a creature moves through.
