# City Scavenger  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](goblin.md)  


You know that the greatest treasures often look like refuse, and you scoff at those who throw away perfectly good scraps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [Subsist](subsist.md), and you can use [Society](../skills.md#Society) or [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) when you [Subsist](subsist.md) in a settlement.

When you [Subsist](subsist.md) in a city, you also gather valuable junk that silly longshanks threw away. You can [Earn Income](earn-income.md) using [Society](../skills.md#Society) or [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) in the same time as you [Subsist](subsist.md), without spending any additional days of downtime. You also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this check.

**Special.** If you have the irongut goblin heritage, increase the bonuses to +2.
