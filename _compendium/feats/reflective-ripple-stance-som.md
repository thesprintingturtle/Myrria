[evocation](evocation.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [stance](stance.md)  [water](water.md)  

- **Requirements**: You're unarmored.
- **Activity** Single Action

You enter a stance of fluid grace as small amounts of water flow with your movements and attacks. You can make flowing wave attacks that deal `1d6` bludgeoning damage.

They are in the brawling group and have the [agile](agile.md), [disarm](rules/traits/disarm.md), [finesse](finesse.md), [nonlethal](nonlethal.md), [trip](rules/traits/trip.md), [unarmed](unarmed.md), and [water](water.md) traits.

While in Reflective Ripple Stance, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) checks to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md), [Swim](swim.md), or [Trip](rules/actions/trip.md), and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Reflex DC to avoid being Disarmed and Tripped.

**Special.** This feat gains your choice of either the [divine](divine.md) or [occult](occult.md) trait, matching your ki spell tradition if possible.

## Reflective Ripple Stance leads to...
