# Dead Reckoning  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Pathfinder Agent Dedication](pathfinder-agent-dedication-lowg.md), trained in [Survival](../skills.md#Survival)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You've trained yourself to maintain a strong sense of direction at all times, even when you can't use a compass or see the sky above. You immediately intuit which direction is north (assuming the concept of north exists at your current location).
