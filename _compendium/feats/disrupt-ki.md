# Disrupt Ki  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 12*  
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [negative](negative.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

Make an unarmed [Strike](strike.md). If it deals damage to a living creature, you block that creature's inner life force. The creature takes `2d6` [persistent negative damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and is [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) until the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends. If you're 18th level or higher, this deals `3d6` [persistent negative damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) instead.
