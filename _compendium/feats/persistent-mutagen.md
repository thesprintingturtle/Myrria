# Persistent Mutagen  *Feat 16*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Extend Elixir](extend-elixir.md)

You've trained your physical form to remain stable within the a given altered state. Once per day, when you consume an [alchemical](alchemical.md) item with the [infused](infused.md) and [mutagen](mutagen.md) traits, you can retain its effects until the next time you make your daily preparations instead of its normal duration.
