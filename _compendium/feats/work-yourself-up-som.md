[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Cathartic Mage Dedication](cathartic-mage-dedication-som.md)
- **Requirements**: You have a reaction available and aren't prevented from using Catharsis.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You concentrate on your mental state, tapping into that raw emotional energy. Take your Catharsis reaction, causing the catharsis activation and entering your emotional fervor as normal. The fervor lasts only until the end of your turn.

At the end of your emotional fervor, you experience the effects of your emotional fallout, as normal.
