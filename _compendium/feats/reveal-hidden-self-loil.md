# Reveal Hidden Self  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 5*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [divine](divine.md)  [illusion](illusion.md)  [tiefling](tiefling-b1.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Beastbrood](beastbrood-loag.md)
- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Requirements**: You're [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to at least one enemy.
- **Activity** Three-Action

While [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden), you manifest a version of your animalistic nature.

You create an illusion of a Large or smaller creature within 60 feet of your location with the effects of the [illusory creature](../spells/illusory-creature.md) spell.

The creature shares your animalistic beastbrood features. Unlike most actions taken while [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden), using Reveal [Hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) Self and Sustaining the Spell don't automatically end your [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) condition. Use the higher of your class DC or spell DC against attempts to disbelieve the illusion. If a creature observes you, it automatically disbelieves the illusion, and if you're no longer [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to at least one enemy, the effect ends.
