# Perfect Resistance  *Feat 8*

- **Prerequisites**: Student of Perfection Dedication

You gain resistance equal to half your level to all damage from effects with the appropriate trait for your School of Perfection: fire for Unblinking Flame, water for Unbreaking Waves, air for Unfolding Wind, and earth for Untwisting Iron.
