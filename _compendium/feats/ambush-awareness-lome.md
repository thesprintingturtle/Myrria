[goloma](goloma-lome.md)  


You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks attempted as initiative rolls.

Additionally, if your initiative roll result is tied with that of an opponent, you go first, regardless of whether you rolled [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) or not.
