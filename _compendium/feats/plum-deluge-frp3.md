# Plum Deluge  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 20*  
[alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have at least three of the same contact poison.
- **Activity** Three-Action

You have learned to saturate an area with poison in imitation of the techniques of your rival, Blue Viper. As part of this ability, you [Interact](interact.md) to draw three vials of the same contact poison and throw them in the air, where they shatter and spread a poisonous deluge affecting a 20-foot burst within 60 feet.

All creatures in the burst are automatically exposed to the poison, immediately bypassing any onset time, and must attempt a saving throw against that poison. The three vials must be identical, even if the poison can come in multiple types or different levels.
