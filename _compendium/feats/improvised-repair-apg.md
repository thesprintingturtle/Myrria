# Improvised Repair  [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") *Feat 3*  
[general](general.md)  

- **Activity** Three-Action

You are skilled at making quick fixes to damaged equipment, but your fixes aren't meant to last forever. You make a quick repair to a [broken](conditions.md#Broken) non-magical item in your possession. Until the item takes damage again, you can still use it as a shoddy item of its type. This repair restores no Hit Points, so the item is easy to destroy. Once the item is Repaired normally such that it is no longer [broken](conditions.md#Broken), it is also no longer shoddy.
