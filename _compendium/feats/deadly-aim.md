- **Prerequisites**: weapon specialization
- **Activity** Single Action

You aim for your prey's weak spots, making your shot more challenging but dealing more damage if you hit. Make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) against your hunted prey at a â€“2 penalty. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to damage on that [Strike](strike.md). This bonus increases to +6 at 11th level and +8 at 15th level.
