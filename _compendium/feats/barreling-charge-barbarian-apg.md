# Barreling Charge (Barbarian)  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: trained in [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You rush forward, moving enemies aside to reach your foe.

You [Stride](stride.md), attempting to move through your enemies' spaces, and make a melee [Strike](strike.md). Roll an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check and compare the result to the Fortitude DC of each creature whose space you attempt to move through during your [Stride](stride.md), moving through its space on a success but ending your movement before entering its space on a failure. You can use Barreling Charge to [Burrow](burrow.md), [Climb](climb.md), [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md), or [Swim](swim.md) instead of [Stride](stride.md), as long as you have the corresponding movement type.
