# Blessed One Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [dedication](dedication.md)  


You are touched by a deity and gifted with the ability to alleviate the suffering of others. You gain the [lay on hands](../spells/lay-on-hands.md) devotion spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell.

This feat grants a focus pool of 1 Focus Point that you can recover using the [Refocus](refocus.md) activity. You can [Refocus](refocus.md) by meditating, whether you reflect on the deity granting the blessing or not, allowing your blessing to refill your focus pool. Your devotion spells from the blessed one archetype are divine spells.

**Special.** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the blessed one archetype.

## Blessed One Dedication leads to...

[Blessed Denial](blessed-denial-apg.md), [Blessed Sacrifice](blessed-sacrifice-apg.md), [Blessed Spell](blessed-spell-apg.md)
