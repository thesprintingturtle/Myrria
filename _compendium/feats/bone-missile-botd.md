# Bone Missile  *Feat 9*  
[skeleton](skeleton-b1.md)  


You can remove your ribs to use them as arrows or bolts. When you draw a rib, you lose 2 HP, and the projectile deals 2 extra negative damage if you [Strike](strike.md) with it before the end of your next turn. The HP loss and extra damage both increase to 3 at 12th level and 4 at 19th level. Your rib cage magically replenishes, and any rib you draw crumbles to dust after being used for a [Strike](strike.md) or at the end of your next turn, whichever comes first.
