# Their Master's Call  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [divine](divine.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Undead Master Dedication](undead-master-dedication-botd.md), Call Companion, at least one inactive undead companion whose remains or anchor are currently in your possession.
- **Activity** Single Action

In a pinch, you pull one of your inactive companions from their rest to provide a companion's support benefit. A fragment of your companion materializes or assembles itself in an unoccupied square of your choice within 30 feet of you, grants you its support benefit, and then disappears on your next turn. If it takes any damage before your next turn, it disappears or collapses (as applicable) and the support benefit ends immediately.
