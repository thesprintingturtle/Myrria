# Inspiring Resilience  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  [champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [emotion](emotion.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Knights of Lastwall have access to this feat.
- **Trigger** You and at least one other creature become the target of a spell or effect with the emotion, [fear](rules/traits/fear.md), or [mental](mental.md) trait that allows a saving throw, and you haven't rolled the save yet.
- **Activity** Reaction

You show defiance in times of hardship and inspire your companions to persevere.

Allies within 30 feet of you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their Will save against the triggering effect, or a +2 circumstance bonus if the effect originated from an undead.
