# Saving Slash  [V](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Varies") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Aldori Duelist Dedication](aldori-duelist-dedication-lowg.md)
- **Trigger** An opponent critically hits you with a melee attack.
- **Activity** Varies ([R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")])

You quickly whirl your blade, trying to deflect enough momentum to avoid the worst of the attack. Attempt a DC 16 flat check. If you succeed, the attack becomes a normal hit, instead of a critical hit.
