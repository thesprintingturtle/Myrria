# Idyllkin  *Feat 1*  
[aasimar](aasimar-apg.md)  [lineage](lineage-apg.md)  


Your wild, unique features betray your agathion birthright. Serene celestials from the plane of Nirvana, agathions seek the peaceful path, ensuring a better world for all to coexist. Your halcyon demeanor leads you to search for peaceful resolution to conflict. You gain the trained proficiency rank in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature). If you would automatically become trained in [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You know the Sylvan language and gain the [Natural Medicine](natural-medicine.md) skill feat.

## Idyllkin leads to...

[Agathion Magic](agathion-magic-loag.md), [Tranquil Sanctuary](tranquil-sanctuary-loag.md)
