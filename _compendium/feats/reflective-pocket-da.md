# Reflective Pocket  *Feat 5*  
[extradimensional](extradimensional.md)  [reflection](reflection-da.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mirror-Risen](mirror-risen-da.md)

You've formed a connection with a small hand mirror, allowing you to use it as an extradimensional storage space. You can store one item of light Bulk in your mirror at a time. Storing or retrieving an item requires an [Interact](interact.md) action and any creature can do so. While an item is stored within the mirror, the mirror reflects the item's image. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) checks to Conceal the Object unless someone checks the mirror's reflection.
