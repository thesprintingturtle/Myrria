- **Requirements**: You and an adjacent creature are both on a narrow surface or uneven ground and the other creature is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed).

You shuffle your feet to dislodge the surface beneath you or otherwise cause your opponent to become unsteady.

Attempt an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check against the adjacent creature's Reflex saving throw DC. On a success, the creature falls. On a critical failure, you fall.
