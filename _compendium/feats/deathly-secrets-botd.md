# Deathly Secrets  *Feat 6*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Reanimator Dedication](reanimator-dedication-botd.md)

No means of creating or ruling the undead is beyond your grasp, even those of magical traditions not your own. You learn either the [eyes of the dead](../spells/eyes-of-the-dead-botd.md) or [subjugate undead](../spells/subjugate-undead-botd.md) focus spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can [Refocus](refocus.md) by meditating over the earthly remains of a dead sentient creature. Focus spells granted by the reanimator archetype are from the same tradition as those used to meet the archetype's prerequisite.

**Special.** You can select this feat more than once. Each time, you learn a different spell and your focus pool increases by 1 Focus Point.
