# Very Sneaky  *Feat 1*  
[goblin](goblin.md)  


Taller folk rarely pay attention to the shadows at their feet, and you take full advantage of this. You can move 5 feet farther when you take the [Sneak](sneak.md) action, up to your Speed. In addition, as long as you continue to use [Sneak](sneak.md) actions and succeed at your [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check, you don't become [observed](conditions.md#Observed) if you don't have cover or greater cover and aren't [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) at the end of the [Sneak](sneak.md) action, as long as you have cover or greater cover or are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) at the end of your turn.
