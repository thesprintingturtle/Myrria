# Collapse  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 1*  
[skeleton](skeleton-b1.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per 10 minutes
- **Trigger** An enemy's [Strike](strike.md) against you is a critical hit.
- **Activity** Reaction

You collapse into a pile of bones, mitigating the worst of the damage you would have taken, and the triggering attack deals only the amount it would deal on a hit (typically full damage instead of double damage). Any other effects caused by a critical hit still occur. While collapsed, you're [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) and can't act except to [Stand](stand.md), which re-forms you into a skeleton in a standing position.
