# Accursed Touch  *Feat 8*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Mummy Dedication](mummy-dedication-botd.md)

You've learned to harness the supernatural curse that animates you, imbuing your most powerful attacks with a terrible curse. When you critically hit with a fist [Strike](strike.md), negative energy binds to it; this is a [curse](curse.md) and a [disease](rules/traits/disease.md). The creature takes `2d6` [persistent negative damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). While the creature has this [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), it's also [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied). The [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases to `3d6` at 14th level and `4d6` at 20th level. This is a critical specialization effect.
