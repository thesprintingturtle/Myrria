# Reflect Foe  *Feat 17*  
[reflection](reflection-da.md)  


You create a copy of a foe by calling them forth from a nearby reflection, clonally growing them in an instant from one of your hairs or otherwise creating them in a way that matches your own nature as a reflection. You can cast [duplicate foe](../spells/duplicate-foe.md) once per day as an innate occult spell. At 20th level, your innate duplicate foe is heightened to 8th level.
