# Form Lock  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 14*  
[attack](attack.md)  [monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  

- **Requirements**: You have a foe [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Single Action

Your ability to control your own ki empowers you to pressure other creatures into resuming their true forms. Attempt an [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check to counteract a [polymorph](polymorph.md) effect currently affecting your target. If the target is somehow under the effect of multiple [polymorph](polymorph.md) effects, you can choose which one to attempt to counteract, or the GM chooses randomly if the separate effects aren't obvious. The target is then temporarily immune for 1 day.
