# Brutal Critical  *Feat 18*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  


Your critical hits are particularly devastating. On a critical hit with a melee [Strike](strike.md), add one extra damage die. This is in addition to any extra dice you gain if the weapon is [deadly](deadly.md) or [fatal](fatal.md). The target also takes [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to two damage dice.
