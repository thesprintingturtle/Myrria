[fighter](rules/traits/fighter.md)  

- **Trigger** You are the target of a physical ranged [Strike](strike.md).
- **Requirements**: You're aware of the attack, not [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against it, and either have a hand free or are wielding a melee weapon.

You can knock aside ranged attacks. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the attack misses, you knocked or cut it out of the air.
