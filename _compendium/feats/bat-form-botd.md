# Bat Form  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [concentrate](concentrate.md)  [divine](divine.md)  [polymorph](polymorph.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Vampire Dedication](vampire-dedication-botd.md)
- **Frequency**: once per hour
- **Activity** Single Action

You can transform into a bat. You gain the effects of a 4th-level [pest form](../spells/pest-form.md) spell. At 14th level, you can choose to spend two actions instead of one to gain the effects of a 4th- or 5th-level [aerial form](../spells/aerial-form.md) spell instead (bat form only).
