# Counterclockwork Focus  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 10*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: Shieldmarshal Dedication
- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Activity** Single Action

You understand the need for law enforcement doctrine to adapt to the ever-changing innovations in technology and arcana. Your training in special weapons and tactics give you access to unusual techniques to respond to clockwork- and magic-related crimes. You apply special additives to a loaded firearm. On your next [Strike](strike.md) with that firearm before the end of your turn, you deal an additional `2d6` damage if the target is a construct, and you can treat the ammunition as your choice of cold iron or adamantine. At 18th level, this additional damage increases to `3d6`, and you can choose to instead treat the ammunition as orichalcum.
