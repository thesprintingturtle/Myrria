# Headshot  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 14*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the sniper
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a loaded firearm or crossbow.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You attempt to finish your target with a final, well-placed shot. Make a crossbow or firearm [Strike](strike.md). If you've damaged the target within the last minute with the same weapon and you get a critical success on your attack roll, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or die; this is a [death](death.md) and [incapacitation](incapacitation.md) effect.

A creature that survives is temporarily immune for 1 day. Creatures with no head (such as dullahans or oozes) are immune to this ability, and creatures with redundant heads (such as ettins) might survive the destruction of a head.
