# Legendary Professional  *Feat 15*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: legendary in [Lore](../skills.md#Lore)

Your fame has spread throughout the lands (for instance, if you have [Warfare Lore](../skills.md#Lore), you might be a legendary general or tactician). This works as [Legendary Performer](legendary-performer.md), except you gain higher-level jobs when you [Earn Income](earn-income.md) with [Lore](../skills.md#Lore).
