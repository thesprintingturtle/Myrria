# Hand of the Lich  *Feat 14*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Lich Dedication](lich-dedication-botd.md)

Negative energy intensifies your undead form and makes your very touch the antithesis of life. You gain the advanced undead benefits (page 44). The damage die for your fist increases to `1d6` instead of `1d4`, it deals negative damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and it loses the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md) trait. Your fist becomes magical.

When you critically hit a living creature with your fist [Strike](strike.md), the creature is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) until the end of your next turn unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save against your spell DC.

This is a critical specialization effect.
