# Smoke Bomb  [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") *Feat 2*  
[additive <1>](additive.md)  [alchemist](rules/traits/alchemist.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per round
- **Trigger** You use [Quick Alchemy](rules/actions/quick-alchemy.md) to craft an alchemical bomb with a level at least 1 lower than your advanced alchemy level.
- **Activity** Free Action

You cause the bomb to create a cloud of thick smoke, in addition to its normal effects. When thrown, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot-radius burst. You choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on. Creatures within that area have the [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition, and all other creatures are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to them. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.
