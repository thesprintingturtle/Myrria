# Aura Of Courage  *Feat 4*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of good

You stand strong in the face of danger and inspire your allies to do the same. Whenever you become [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened), reduce the condition value by 1 (to a minimum of 0). At the end of your turn when you would reduce your [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition value by 1, you also reduce the value by 1 for all allies within 15 feet.
