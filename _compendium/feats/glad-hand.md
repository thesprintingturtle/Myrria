# Glad-hand  *Feat 2*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)

First impressions are your strong suit. When you meet someone in a casual or social situation, you can immediately attempt a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) on that creature rather than needing to converse for 1 minute. You take a â€“5 penalty to the check. If you fail or critically fail, you can engage in 1 minute of conversation and attempt a new check at the end of that time rather than accepting the failure or critical failure result.
