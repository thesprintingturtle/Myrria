# Shoulder Catastrophe  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 12*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Swordmaster Dedication](swordmaster-dedication-locg.md)
- **Trigger** An enemy critically succeeds at a [Strike](strike.md) against an adjacent ally.
- **Activity** Reaction

You've trained to protect your allies by diverting the worst attacks to yourself. The enemy doesn't double the damage from the triggering [Strike](strike.md) but instead applies the normal damage to both you and your ally. Both of you take any effects that would happen on a hit that dealt damage, such as poison, but neither of you are subject to any effects that would happen only on a critical success.
