# Scapegoat Parallel Self  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 20*  
[divine](divine.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Frequency**: once per day
- **Trigger** Your turn starts or your oracular curse would advance.
- **Activity** Reaction

Seeing Syndara superimpose creatures with similar metaphysical properties, you've realized a way to manipulate the effects of your oracular curse.

You immediately change your curse to its minor, moderate, or major stage, or back to its mild form, exchanging the [curse](curse.md) effect with that of a parallel version of yourself in another reality.
