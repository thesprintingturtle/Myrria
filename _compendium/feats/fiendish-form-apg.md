# Fiendish Form  *Feat 18*  
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: tenets of evil

Your features reshape into those of a type of fiend who serves your deity; for example, as a demon you might have putrid scales, twisted horns, and red eyes. You gain a fly Speed equal to your Speed. You gain [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) if you don't already have it, and you gain the [fiend](fiend.md) trait and the trait appropriate to the type of servitor you've become (such as daemon, demon, or devil).
