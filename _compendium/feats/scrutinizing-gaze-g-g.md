# Scrutinizing Gaze  *Feat 13*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Dongun Hold or Alkenstar.

Your family's traditions of defending against Geb's undead have granted you a sixth sense for detecting spirits, haunts, and other restless dead, no matter their form or the strength of their presence. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Sense Motive](sense-motive.md) when trying to determine if a creature is possessed or under the influence of an effect that would make them [controlled](conditions.md#Controlled), a +2 circumstance bonus to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks made to see through disguises worn by undead, and a +2 circumstance bonus when using the [Seek](seek.md) action to find [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) or [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) haunts or undead within 30 feet of you.

If you aren't using the [Seek](seek.md) action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice haunts or undead within 30 feet anyway. This check doesn't gain the usual +2 circumstance bonus, and instead takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty.
