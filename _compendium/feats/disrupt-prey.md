# Disrupt Prey  [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") *Feat 4*  
[ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  

- **Trigger** Your hunted prey is within your reach, and it uses a [manipulate](manipulate.md) action, uses a [move](move.md) action, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.
- **Activity** Reaction

Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) against your prey. If the attack is a critical hit, you disrupt the triggering action.
