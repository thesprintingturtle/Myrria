# Fane's Escape  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[general](general.md)  [skill](skill.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: expert in [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth)
- **Requirements**: You have a deck of playing cards in your possession.
- **Activity** Two-Action

A good getaway requires a good distraction. You [Interact](interact.md) to draw a deck of cards and flip it in a fluttering explosion, causing you to become briefly [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to all other creatures using vision as their precise sense, and then you [Sneak](sneak.md). You have enough cover to [Sneak](sneak.md) until the end of your turn. This leaves all of the cards from the deck scattered about the room; collecting them into a deck again takes several minutes.
