# Lion Blade Dedication  *Feat 2*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [dedication](dedication.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: You are from Taldor.
- **Prerequisites**: member of the Lion Blades, trained in [Performance](../skills.md#Performance)

Your lion blade spy training helps you conceal yourself and your identity. You become trained in your choice of [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) or [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) and in [Espionage Lore](../skills.md#Lore); if you were already trained, you become an expert instead. You never take circumstance penalties for attempting to take a disguise of a different ancestry, age, and so on, as long as the disguised form is appropriate for your size.

**Special.** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Lion Blade archetype.

## Lion Blade Dedication leads to...

[Expeditious Advance](expeditious-advance-lowg.md), [Flicker](flicker-lowg.md), [Lost In The Crowd](lost-in-the-crowd-lowg.md), [Crowd Mastery](crowd-mastery-lowg.md), [Spy's Countermeasures](spys-countermeasures-lowg.md)
