- **Prerequisites**: [Marshal Dedication](marshal-dedication-apg.md), trained in [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy)

You become a brilliant example of dedication and poise in battle, encouraging your allies to follow suit. When you spend this action, attempt a [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) check. The DC is usually a standard-difficulty DC of your level, but the GM can assign a different DC based on the circumstances. The effect depends on the result of your check.
