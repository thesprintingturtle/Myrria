You can lie about having taken an action so convincingly that you acquire all the tangible benefits of having successfully completed it. You can roll [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) in place of a different skill when attempting to [Earn Income](earn-income.md), [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md), [Request](request.md), or [Subsist](subsist.md). You can use Fabricated Connections to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) or [Request](request.md) once per day, and you can also use it once per week to [Earn Income](earn-income.md) or [Subsist](subsist.md).
