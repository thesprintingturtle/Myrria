# Coordinated Distraction  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 12*  
[concentrate](concentrate.md)  [rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Access**: Help either the Washboard Dogs or the Diobel Sweepers destroy their rival.
- **Activity** Single Action

With a sharp whistle or wave of your hands, you distract an opponent from the fact that one of your allies is about to attack them. Choose a target and an ally, both of whom must be within 30 feet. The target is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against the first [Strike](strike.md) the ally makes on their next turn; if your ally doesn't [Strike](strike.md) that target, the effect is lost. Depending on how you describe your distraction, this action gains either the [auditory](auditory.md) or [visual](visual.md) trait.
