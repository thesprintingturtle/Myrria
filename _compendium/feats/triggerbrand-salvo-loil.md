# Triggerbrand Salvo  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 6*  
[flourish](flourish.md)  [gunslinger](rules/traits/gunslinger-g-g.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: way of the triggerbrand
- **Requirements**: You're wielding a combination weapon.
- **Activity** Single Action

You slice, stab, or batter your opponent with the melee portion of your combination weapon before pulling the trigger at point-blank range. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) with your combination weapon. If the [Strike](strike.md) is successful, you can immediately make a ranged [Strike](strike.md) against the same target with that combination weapon, and you get a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll. This counts as two attacks toward your multiple attack penalty, but you don't apply the multiple attack penalty until after making both attacks.
