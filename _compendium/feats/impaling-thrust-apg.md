# Impaling Thrust  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 14*  
[barbarian](rules/traits/barbarian.md)  [rage](rules/traits/rage.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are wielding a melee weapon that deals piercing damage.
- **Activity** Two-Action

You impale your enemy and hold them in place with your weapon. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md) with the required weapon. If the [Strike](strike.md) hits and deals damage, your target is [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed) until they successfully [Escape](escape.md), you attack with the required weapon, or you [Release](release.md) the required weapon, whichever comes first. When the target is no longer [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed), they take [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) equal to the number of weapon damage dice.
