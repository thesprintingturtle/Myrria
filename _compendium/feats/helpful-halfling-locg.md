# Helpful Halfling  *Feat 9*  
[halfling](halfling.md)  


When you aid a friend with a task, you find many ways to help and avoid interfering.

On a critical success to [Aid](aid.md), you grant your ally a +3 circumstance bonus if you have expert proficiency in the skill (rather than +2), and you grant your ally a +4 circumstance bonus if you have master proficiency (rather than +3). If you roll a critical failure on a check to [Aid](aid.md), you don't give your ally a â€“1 circumstance penalty to their check.
