# Jungle Strider  *Feat 1*  
[grippli](grippli-b2.md)  


You are adept at dodging roots, foliage, and other jungle obstacles. You ignore difficult terrain in forests and jungles. In addition, when you use the [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) skill to [Balance](balance.md) on narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of plant material, you aren't [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed), and when you roll a success at one of these [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks, you get a critical success instead.
