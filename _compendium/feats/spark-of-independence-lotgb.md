# Spark Of Independence  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 5*  
[poppet](poppet-lotgb.md)  

- **Activity** Two-Action

You touch a creature with the [minion](minion.md) trait and share the heightened sense of autonomy you've discovered. The minion is [quickened](conditions.md#Quickened) for 1 round and is then temporarily immune for 10 minutes. It can use this extra action to [Step](step.md), [Stride](stride.md), or [Strike](strike.md).
