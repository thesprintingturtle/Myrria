# Forgotten Presence  *Feat 8*  
[druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  


The world conspires to keep you forgotten and [unnoticed](conditions.md#Unnoticed)— memories cloud, ink stains out your name in ledgers, and portraits of you crack and warp over your face. Characters attempting to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) about you take a –2 circumstance penalty.

Add [modify memory](../spells/modify-memory.md) to your spell list as a primal spell.
