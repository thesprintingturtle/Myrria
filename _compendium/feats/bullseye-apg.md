# Bullseye  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 8*  
[rogue](rules/traits/rogue.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You carefully take aim before making your attack in order to avoid your foe's concealment and cover. On your next [Strike](strike.md) with a thrown weapon before the end of your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll and ignore your target's [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition, as well as the target's lesser cover or standard cover; if the target had greater cover, they instead have only standard cover against the [Strike](strike.md).
