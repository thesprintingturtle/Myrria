# Widen Spell (Oracle)  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 1*  
[manipulate](manipulate.md)  [metamagic](metamagic.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  

- **Activity** Single Action

You manipulate the energy of your spell, causing it to affect a wider area. If the next action you use is to [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and doesn't have a duration, increase the area of that spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with a smaller radius isn't affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.
