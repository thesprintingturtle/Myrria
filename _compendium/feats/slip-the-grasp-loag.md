# Slip The Grasp  [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") *Feat 9*  
[fleshwarp](fleshwarp-loag.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  

- **Requirements**: You are [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized), or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained).
- **Activity** Single Action

You have some feature that allows you to quickly evade effects that restrain you. Attempt a check to [Escape](escape.md). If you succeed, you can [Stride](stride.md), [Step](step.md), or make a [Strike](strike.md) with a melee unarmed attack targeting the creature you Escaped from. If you fail, you instead attempt to [Escape](escape.md) a second time.

You increase your multiple attack penalty as appropriate for the actions you took, but only after completing both actions.
