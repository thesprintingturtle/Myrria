# Scout's Charge  [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") *Feat 4*  
[archetype](archetype.md)  [flourish](flourish.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Scout Dedication](scout-dedication-apg.md)
- **Activity** Two-Action

You meander around unpredictably, and then ambush your opponents without warning. Choose one enemy. [Stride](stride.md), [Feint](feint.md) against that opponent, and then make a [Strike](strike.md) against that foe. For your [Feint](feint.md), you can attempt a [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth) check instead of the [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check that's usually required, because you use the terrain around you to catch your foe off-guard.
