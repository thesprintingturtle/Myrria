# Dwarven Weapon Cunning  *Feat 5*  
[dwarf](dwarf.md)  

- **Prerequisites**: [Dwarven Weapon Familiarity](dwarven-weapon-familiarity.md)

You've learned cunning techniques to get the best effects out of your dwarven weapons. Whenever you critically hit using a [battle axe](../equipment/items/battle-axe.md), [pick](../equipment/items/pick.md), [warhammer](../equipment/items/warhammer.md), or a dwarf weapon, you apply the weapon's critical specialization effect.
