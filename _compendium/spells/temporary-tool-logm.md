# Temporary Tool *Spell 1*   
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md)
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Duration**until used or 1 minute; see text

You conjure a temporary simple tool, such as a shovel or rope into your hands. It lasts until it is used for a single activity or for 1 minute, whichever comes first, after which it disappears. The tool is obviously temporarily conjured, and thus can't be sold or passed off as a genuine item.
