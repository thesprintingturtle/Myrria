# Distracting Chatter *Spell 3*   
[auditory](auditory.md)  [illusion](illusion.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You bombard a target with distracting auditory illusions, surrounding them with a tumultuous cacophony of overlapping speech, whispers, screams, and muttering.

The target is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed), takes a â€“2 status penalty to purely auditory [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks, and must succeed at a DC 5 flat check to use auditory abilities or verbal spell components. Similarly, a creature who attempts to affect the target with an [auditory](auditory.md) effect must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the attempt fails. The duration depends on the target's Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The duration is 1 round.
> - **Failure** The duration is 3 rounds.
> - **Critical Failure** The duration is 1 minute.

**Heightened (7th)** You can target up to five creatures.
