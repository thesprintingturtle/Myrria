# Buffeting Winds *Spell 1*   
[air](air.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [nonlethal](nonlethal.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot cone
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

You release a quick burst of wind that batters your living opponents without causing them lasting harm, while also blowing undead away. The wind deals `2d4` bludgeoning damage, which is nonlethal against living creatures. Against undead, the winds are more vicious, and the spell loses the [nonlethal](nonlethal.md) trait against such creatures. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, undead creatures are also knocked back 5 feet (or 10 feet on a critical failure).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d4`.
