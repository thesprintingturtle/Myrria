# Weaponize Secret *Focus 4*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [divination](divination.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [rare](rare.md)  

- **Domains**: [[secrecy (apocryphal)](../domains.md#Secrecy%20(apocryphal))]
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**up to 3 creatures
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

You understand that holding a secret is in itself a kind of power. Each target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** A rune symbolizing a secret the target is keeping (at the GM's discretion) appears floating in front of you. If that creature attempts a [Strike](strike.md) or spell attack against you while you hold their secret, you can discharge the rune as a reaction to deal `7d6` mental damage to the creature.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target becomes convinced you know their secret and takes `1d6` [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from worry. If the rune with the secret is discharged while the creature is still taking the [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), the [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) immediately ends.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The mental damage increases by `2d6`, and the [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a critical failure increases by 1.
