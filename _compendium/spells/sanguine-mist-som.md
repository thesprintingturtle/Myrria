# Sanguine Mist *Spell 4*   
[death](death.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [negative](negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You unleash a cloud of foul, blood-sucking fog that drains the vitality from the living to bolster your own. Each living creature in the area when you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md), aside from you, takes `6d6` negative damage with a basic Fortitude save. Creatures in the area are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed), and all creatures outside the cloud become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it.

The first time each round you Sustain this Spell on subsequent turns, living creatures in the area take an additional `2d6` negative damage with another basic Fortitude save. You also gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage a single creature took when you Sustained the spell this turn; calculate these temporary Hit Points using the creature that took the most damage. You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `2d6` and the secondary damage increases by `1d6`.
