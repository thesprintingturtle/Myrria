# Thoughtful Gift *Spell 1*   
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  [teleportation](teleportation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 willing creature

You teleport one object of light or negligible Bulk held in your hand to the target. The object appears instantly in the target's hand, if they have a free hand, or at their feet if they don't. The target knows what object you are attempting to send them.

If the target is [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) or refuses to accept your gift, or if the spell would teleport a creature (even if the creature is inside an extradimensional container), the spell fails.

**Heightened (3rd)** The spell's range increases to 500 feet.

**Heightened (5th)** As 3rd level, and the object's maximum Bulk increases to 1. You can [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md) with 3 actions instead of 1; doing so increases the range to 1 mile and you don't need line of sight to the target, but you must be extremely familiar with the target.
