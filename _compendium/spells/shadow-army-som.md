# Shadow Army *Spell 10*   
[auditory](auditory.md)  [illusion](illusion.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [shadow](rules/traits/shadow.md)  [visual](visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Area**50-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

You create dozens of semi-real copies of yourself that swarm across the battlefield and fight your enemies. You are virtually indistinguishable from your clones, allowing you to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](sneak.md) among them. An enemy that's in the area when the spell is cast or that ends its turn in the area takes `3d10` mental damage and `3d10` bludgeoning damage, and is possibly inflicted with a condition, depending on the result of its Will save. When you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md), you choose a condition your shadows impose on a failed save: [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy), [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled), [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed), or [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature takes no damage. For the duration of the spell, the creature gets a result one step better than it rolled on further saves against the spell, and can distinguish you from your clones without difficulty.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage, and gains the chosen condition.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, and gains the chosen condition.
