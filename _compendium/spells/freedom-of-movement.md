# Freedom Of Movement *Spell 4*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)

- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature touched

You repel effects that would hinder a creature or slow its movement. While under this spell's effect, the target ignores effects that would give them a circumstance penalty to Speed. When they attempt to [Escape](escape.md) an effect that has them [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized), [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed), or [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained), they automatically succeed unless the effect is magical and of a higher level than the [freedom of movement](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/freedom-of-movement.md) spell.
