# Claim Undead *Focus 6*   
[cursebound](cursebound-apg.md)  [incapacitation](incapacitation.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 undead creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**10 minutes

You attempt to wrest control of a target undead or force it to recognize you as its master. If the target is [controlled](conditions.md#Controlled) by another creature, that controller attempts a Will saving throw to retain control; otherwise, the target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) as it fights off your commands.
> - **Failure** The target becomes [controlled](conditions.md#Controlled) by you and follows your orders. It (or the creature previously controlling it) can attempt a new Will save at the end of each of its turns, and the spell ends on a success. If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target (or the creature previously controlling it) receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature.
