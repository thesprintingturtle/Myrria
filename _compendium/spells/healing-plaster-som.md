# Healing Plaster *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](cantrip.md)  [earth](earth.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**5 foot
- **Targets**a handful of dirt or mud
- **Duration**10 minutes

You purify some dirt or mud into a pliable, claylike plaster that can aid in clotting and healing. This restorative substance can be used in lieu of healer's tools for [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) checks to [Administer First Aid](administer-first-aid.md) or [Treat Wounds](treat-wounds.md). If the plaster isn't used within the spell's duration, or if you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md) again before using the plaster, it reverts to being normal non-magical earth.

**Heightened (3rd)** The plaster grants anyone using it to [Administer First Aid](administer-first-aid.md) or [Treat Wounds](treat-wounds.md) a +1 item bonus to the [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine) check.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
