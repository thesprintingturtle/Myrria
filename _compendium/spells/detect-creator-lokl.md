# Detect Creator *Spell 4*

- **Targets**1 destroyed undead
- **Duration**sustained

You examine the remains or spiritual residue of a destroyed undead creature to locate that undead's creator, perhaps a necromancer or vampire. If the creator is within range, you can sense the direction to them. If the creator is within 100 feet, you sense their presence within 100 feet, and the spell ends; you can't further home in on their location. If there's lead or running water between you and the undead's creator, this spell can't locate them. This spell fails automatically if the undead doesn't have a specific creator or the specific creator isn't on the same plane.
