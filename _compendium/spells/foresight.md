# Foresight *Spell 9*   
[divination](divination.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [prediction](prediction.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**1 hour

You gain a sixth sense that warns you of danger that might befall the target of the spell. If you choose a creature other than yourself as the target, you create a psychic link through which you can inform the target of danger. This link is a [mental](mental.md) effect. Due to the amount of information this spell requires you to process, you can't have more than one [foresight](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/foresight.md) spell in effect at a time. Casting foresight again ends the previous foresight. While foresight is in effect, the target gains a +2 status bonus to initiative rolls and isn't [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) against [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) creatures or when flanked. In addition, you gain the following reaction.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Foresight [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: The target of foresight defends against a [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) creature or other danger.

**Effect** If the [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) creature or danger forces the target to roll dice (a saving throw, for example), the target rolls twice and uses the higher result, and this spell gains the [fortune](../../../rules/traits/fortune.md) trait. But if the [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) creature or danger is rolling against the target (an attack roll or skill check, for example), that [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) creature or danger rolls twice and uses the lower result, and this spell gains the [misfortune](../../../rules/traits/misfortune.md) trait.
