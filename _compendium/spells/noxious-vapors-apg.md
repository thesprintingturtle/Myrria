# Noxious Vapors *Spell 1*   
[evocation](evocation.md)  [poison](rules/traits/poison.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**10-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude
- **Duration**1 round

You emit a cloud of toxic smoke that temporarily obscures you from sight. Each creature except you in the area when you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md) takes `1d6` poison damage (basic Fortitude save). A creature that critically fails the saving throw also becomes [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened). All creatures in the area become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed), and all creatures outside the smoke become [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to creatures within it. This smoke can be dispersed by a strong wind.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
