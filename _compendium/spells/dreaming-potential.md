# Dreaming Potential *Spell 5*   
[enchantment](enchantment.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** 10 minutes 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 willing sleeping creature
- **Duration**8 hours

You draw the target into a lucid dream where it can explore the endless possibilities of its own potential within the everchanging backdrop of its dreamscape. If it sleeps the full 8 hours uninterrupted, when it wakes, it counts as having spent a day of downtime retraining, though it can't use dreaming potential for any retraining that would require either an instructor or specialized knowledge it can't access within the dream.
