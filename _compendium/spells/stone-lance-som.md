# Stone Lance *Focus 3*   
[attack](attack.md)  [earth](earth.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**1 minute

You conjure a jagged lance of stone and then launch it at a foe. Make a spell attack roll against the target.

On a hit, you deal `6d6` piercing damage and the lance impales the creature, giving it a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds unless it [Escapes](escape.md). On a critical hit, if the creature is on the ground, the lance also embeds into the ground and immobilizes the creature until it [Escapes](escape.md). A creature that [Escapes](escape.md) after being impaled takes 3 [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). When the spell ends, the lance crumbles into dirt, freeing the target if it hasn't Escaped.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the damage by `2d6` and the [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) for [Escapes](escape.md) by 1.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
