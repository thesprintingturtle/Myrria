For each question, the target can attempt a [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) check against your spell DC; if the target succeeds, you don't learn the answer, and on a critical success, the target gives you a false answer that you believe is truthful Once you've asked the target a given question, asking it again, even with a separate casting of mind probe, produces the same result.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target takes a â€“4 circumstance penalty to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks against your questions.
