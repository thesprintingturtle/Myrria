# Juvenile Companion *Spell 1*   
[polymorph](polymorph.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**your companion
- **Duration**10 minutes

You transform your companion into its juvenile form, such as a cub, foal, kitten, puppy, or piglet, making the target appear harmless. It becomes Tiny (if it was larger), and its reach is reduced to 0 feet. All of its Speeds are halved (to a minimum Speed of 5 feet), and it gains weakness 5 to physical damage. In all other ways, its abilities and statistics are unchanged.

If your companion uses a [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) action, juvenile companion ends. This spell has no effect on a companion that doesn't have a juvenile form.

**Heightened (2nd)** The duration increases to 1 hour.
