# Tree Shape *Spell 2*   
[plant](plant.md)  [polymorph](polymorph.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**8 hours

You transform into a Large tree. [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks don't reveal your true nature, but a successful [Nature](../skills.md#Nature) or [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) check against your spell DC reveals that you appear to be a tree that is strangely new to the area. While in tree form, you can observe everything around you, but you can't act other than to end the spell, and your turn, by using a single action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait. As a tree, your AC is 20, and only status bonuses, status penalties, circumstance bonuses, and circumstance penalties affect you. Any successes and critical successes you roll on Reflex saves are failures.
