# Chromatic Wall *Spell 5*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Duration**10 minutes

You create an opaque wall of light in a single vibrant color.

The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high. If the wall would pass through a creature, the spell is lost. The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet on each side, and dim light for the next 20 feet. You can ignore the wall's effects.

Roll `1d4` to determine the color of the wall. Each color has a particular effect on items, effects, or creatures that attempt to pass through. Chromatic wall can't be counteracted normally; rather, each color is automatically counteracted when targeted by a specific spell, even if that spell's level is lower than that of chromatic wall.

- **Red** The wall destroys ranged weapon ammunition (such as arrows and crossbow bolts) that would pass through, and it deals 20 fire damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. [Cone of cold](cone-of-cold.md) can counteract a red chromatic wall.
- **Orange** The wall destroys thrown weapons that would pass through, and it deals 25 acid damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. [Gust of wind](gust-of-wind.md) can counteract an orange chromatic wall.
- **Yellow** The wall stops [acid](acid.md), [cold](cold.md), [electricity](electricity.md), [fire](fire.md), [force](force.md), [negative](negative.md), [positive](positive.md), and [sonic](sonic.md) effects from passing through, and it deals 30 electricity damage to anyone passing through, with a basic Reflex save. [Disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md) can counteract a yellow chromatic wall.
- **Green** The wall stops toxins, gases, and breath weapons from passing through. It deals 10 poison damage to anyone passing through and makes them [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute. A basic Fortitude save reduces the damage and negates the [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition on a success. [Passwall](compendium/spells/passwall.md) can counteract a green chromatic wall.

**Heightened (7th)** The spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Roll `1d8` to determine the wall's color; the results for 5–8 are below. A red, orange, yellow, or green wall deals an extra 10 damage.

- 5. **Blue** The wall stops [auditory](auditory.md), petrification, [sonic](sonic.md), and [visual](visual.md) effects from passing through, and creatures passing through are subject to the effects of [flesh to stone](flesh-to-stone.md). [Magic missile](magic-missile.md) can counteract a blue chromatic wall.
- 6. **Indigo** The wall stops [divination](divination.md) and [mental](mental.md) effects from passing through, and those passing through are subject to the effects of [warp mind](warp-mind.md). [Searing light](searing-light.md) can counteract an indigo chromatic wall.
- 7. **Violet** The wall prevents spells from targeting the other side (area effects still cross as normal). Creatures passing through must succeed at a Will save or they are [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute; on a critical failure, the creature is instead sent to another plane, with the effect of [plane shift](plane-shift.md). [Dispel magic](dispel-magic.md) can counteract a violet chromatic wall.
- 8. Reroll, and creatures that pass through the wall take a –2 circumstance penalty to their saves.
