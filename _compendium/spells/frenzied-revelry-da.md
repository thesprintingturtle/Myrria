You recall memories of hedonistic rites to send yourself into an infectious frenzy, dancing and howling wildly to encourage your companions to join in. You and your allies gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against [mental](mental.md) effects while in the area. Whenever someone benefiting from this bonus critically succeeds at a saving throw against an enemy's [mental](mental.md) effect, its revelry increases, granting it a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round.

**Heightened (4th)** The emanation's radius is 10 feet, and the status bonus to saves is +2.

**Heightened (7th)** The emanation's radius is 15 feet, and the status bonus to saves is +3.
