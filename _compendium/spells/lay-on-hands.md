# Lay On Hands *Focus 1*   
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [healing](healing.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [positive](positive.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature

Your hands become infused with positive energy, healing a living creature or damaging an undead creature with a touch.

If you use lay on hands on a willing living target, you restore 6 Hit Points; if the target is one of your allies, they also gain a +2 status bonus to AC for 1 round. Against an undead target, you deal `1d6` damage and it must attempt a basic Fortitude save; if it fails, it also takes a â€“2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of healing increases by 6, and the damage to an undead target increases by `1d6`.
