# Rebuke Death *Focus 4*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [healing](healing.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [positive](positive.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[healing](../setting/domains.md#Healing)]
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Area**20-foot emanation
- **Targets**1 living creature per action spent to cast this spell

You snatch creatures from the jaws of death. You can spend 1 to 3 actions [Casting this Spell](cast-a-spell.md), and you can target a number of creatures equal to the actions spent. Each target regains `3d6` Hit Points. If the target had the [dying](conditions.md#Dying) condition, coming back from [dying](conditions.md#Dying) due to this healing doesn't increase its [wounded](conditions.md#Wounded) condition.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the healing by `1d6`.
