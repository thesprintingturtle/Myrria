# Command *Spell 1*   
[auditory](auditory.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [linguistic](linguistic.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**until the end of the target's next turn

You shout a command that's hard to ignore. You can command the target to approach you, run away (as if it had the [fleeing](conditions.md#Fleeing) condition), release what it's holding, [Drop Prone](drop-prone.md), or stand in place. It can't [Delay](delay.md) or take any reactions until it has obeyed your command. The effects depend on the target's Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** For the first action on its next turn, the creature must use a single action to do as you command.
> - **Critical Failure** The target must use all its actions on its next turn to obey your command.

**Heightened (5th)** You can target up to 10 creatures.
