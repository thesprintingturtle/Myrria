# Clawsong *Spell 2*   
[transmutation](transmutation.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 willing creature with an unarmed claw [Strike](strike.md)
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You sing a fierce prayer, low and growling, and awaken the ancient spirit of a Terwa beast to guide and strengthen the target's unarmed blows. The target's claw attack gains the versatile (piercing) trait, and deals `1d6` slashing damage. If the target's claw attack already deals `1d6` slashing damage, it deals `1d8` instead. If its claw attack already had the versatile (piercing) trait, it gains the deadly `1d8` trait.

**Heightened (4th)** The spell can affect up to 6 willing creatures with unarmed claw [Strikes](strike.md).
