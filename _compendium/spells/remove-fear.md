# Remove Fear *Spell 2*   
[enchantment](enchantment.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature

With a touch, you ease a creature's fears. You can attempt to counteract a single [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effect that the target suffers from.

This frees only the target, not any other creatures under the [fear](rules/traits/fear.md) effect.

**Heightened (6th)** The spell's range increases to 30 feet, and you can target up to 10 creatures.
