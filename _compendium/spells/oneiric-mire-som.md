# Oneiric Mire *Spell 3*   
[illusion](illusion.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [visual](visual.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Duration**1 minute

You shroud an area in illusory dreamstuff, making the ground look and feel like a deep mire or quicksand. Ground in the area is difficult terrain.

Each creature in the area when the spell is cast, or that enters the area, must attempt a Will save. On a failure, it believes it's being pulled down by the earth, taking a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds. On a critical failure, it's also [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized). In addition to the normal actions to [Escape](escape.md), at the end of an affected creature's turn, it can attempt a Will save, removing the effects on a success. On a critical success at any Will save made against oneiric mire, the creature fully 0 and no longer needs to make Will saves to risk a Speed penalty or being [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized), though the area is still difficult terrain.
