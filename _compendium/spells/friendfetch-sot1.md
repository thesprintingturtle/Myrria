# Friendfetch *Spell 1*   
[evocation](evocation.md)  [force](force.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 or 2 willing creatures

You shoot out ephemeral, telekinetic strands that drag each target directly toward you, stopping in the closest unoccupied space to you in this path. This is forced movement.
