# Aberrant Form *Spell 5*   
[polymorph](polymorph.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Harnessing the power of vile entities, you transform yourself into a Large aberration. You must have enough space to expand into or the spell is lost. When you cast this spell, choose chuul, gogiteth, gug, or otyugh. While in this form, you gain the [aberration](aberration.md) trait. You can [Dismiss](dismiss.md) the spell.

You gain the following statistics and abilities regardless of which battle form you choose:

- AC = 18 + your level. Ignore your armor's check penalty and Speed reduction.
- 13 temporary Hit Points.
- [Darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md).
- One or more unarmed melee attacks specific to the battle form you choose, which are the only attacks you can [Strike](strike.md) with. You're trained with them. Your attack modifier is +18, and you use the listed damage. These attacks are Strength based (for the purpose of the [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) condition, for example). If your unarmed attack modifier is higher, you can use it instead.
- [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) modifier of +20, unless your own modifier is higher. You also gain specific abilities based on the type of aberration you choose:
- **Chuul** Speed 30 feet, swim 25 feet; **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") claw (reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d8+8` bludgeoning, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target.
- **Gogiteth** Speed 40 feet, climb 30 feet; **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws, **Damage** `2d10+8` piercing, and you can spend an action after a hit to Grab the target; **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") leg (agile, reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d6+8` piercing.
- **Gug** Speed 40 feet, climb 20 feet; **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") jaws (reach <10 feet>), **Damage** `2d12+8` piercing; **Melee** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")
