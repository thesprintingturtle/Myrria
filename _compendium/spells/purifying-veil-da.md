# Purifying Veil *Focus 4*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [good](good.md)  [rare](rare.md)  [water](water.md)  

- **Domains**: [[water (apocryphal)](../setting/domains.md#Water%20(apocryphal))]
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 Large or smaller creature
- **Duration**1 minute

Drawing on the purifying powers of water, you call forth a veil of fine water droplets suffused with holy energy. The veil surrounds the target. Everything on each side of the veil is [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) from creatures on the opposite side, but the water doesn't impede attacks or movement across the veil. If the target moves through the veil, it takes `4d6` good damage with a basic Will save. If the target leaves the veil, the spell ends.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The good damage increases by `1d6`.
