# Blink *Spell 4*   
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  [teleportation](teleportation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You gain resistance 5 to all damage (except force). You can [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md) to vanish and reappear 10 feet away in a random direction determined by the GM; the movement doesn't trigger reactions. At the end of your turn, you vanish and reappear as above.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The resistance increases by 3.
