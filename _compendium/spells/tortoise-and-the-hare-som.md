# Tortoise And The Hare *Spell 4*   
[transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](occult.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 foe, and either yourself or 1 ally
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You prove that slow and steady doesn't always win the race by turning a foe into a proverbial tortoise and yourself or an ally into a hare, siphoning some of the foe's speed and granting it to the other target. The effects depend on the foe's Fortitude save.
