# Lock Item *Spell 2*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 object held by 1 creature and the creature holding it
- **Saving Throw** Reflex
- **Duration**varies

One object held by a creature becomes fused to that creature's hand and can't be put down. To [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) or [Steal](steal.md) the item, the result of the skill check must exceed the spell's DC or the normal DC, whichever is higher. To voluntarily drop the weapon, the target must spend an [Interact](interact.md) action rather than a free action, and then succeed at a Reflex save. On a failed save, the action is wasted, but on a success, they drop the item and the spell ends. An unwilling creature must attempt an initial Reflex save against lock item. A willing creature can choose to critically fail the saving throw.

> [!success-degree]

> - **Success** The creature is affected for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature is affected for 4 rounds.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is affected for 1 minute.
