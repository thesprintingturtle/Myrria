# Phase Bolt *Cantrip 1*   
[attack](attack.md)  [cantrip](cantrip.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You point your finger and project a bolt of magical energy that stutters in and out of phase until it reaches the target. Make a ranged spell attack roll against your target's AC; if the target has any circumstance bonuses to AC (such as from a shield or cover), reduce that bonus by 2 for this attack. On a success, you deal `1d4` piercing damage plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, the target takes double damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The bolt's damage increases by `1d4`.
