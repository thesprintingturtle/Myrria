# Clownish Curse *Spell 4*   
[attack](attack.md)  [curse](curse.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [misfortune](misfortune.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You afflict the target with a curse that causes it to emit ridiculous noises as it moves. Furthermore, the target's hands and feet become awkward and uncoordinated, as though it were wearing oversized gloves and shoes.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** For 1 round, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth), or [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check. If the target rolls a failure at an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics), [Stealth](../skills.md#Stealth), or [Thievery](../skills.md#Thievery) check, it gets a critical failure instead.
> - **Failure** As success, but the effect is 1 hour.
> - **Critical Failure** As success, except the effect is permanent.
