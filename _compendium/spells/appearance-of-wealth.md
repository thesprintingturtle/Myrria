You create a brief vision of immense wealth filling the spell's area. Each creature within 20 feet of the area that could be enticed by material wealth must attempt a Will saving throw. A creature that enters the area automatically 0, and disbelieving the illusion ends any [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) condition imposed by the spell. As long as you [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md), other creatures react to the treasure like they would any other illusion, but they are not at risk of becoming [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated).
