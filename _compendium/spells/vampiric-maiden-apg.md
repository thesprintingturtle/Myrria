# Vampiric Maiden *Spell 4*   
[necromancy](necromancy.md)  [negative](negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

A ghostly iron maiden snaps shut on the target and drains its vitality for your gain. This deals `4d4` piercing damage and `4d4` negative damage, and the target must attempt a Fortitude save. You gain temporary HP equal to the negative damage the target takes (after applying resistances, weaknesses, and the like). You lose any remaining temporary HP after 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The target is briefly trapped within the vampiric maiden. The target takes full damage and is [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized) by the iron maiden for 1 round or until it uses an [Interact](interact.md) action to extricate itself, whichever comes first.
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double damage and is [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized) by the vampiric maiden for 1 round or until it [Escapes](escape.md) (the DC is your spell DC), whichever comes first.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The piercing and negative damage increase by `1d4` each.
