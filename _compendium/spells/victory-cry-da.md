# Victory Cry *Focus 1*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [rare](rare.md)  [sonic](sonic.md)  

- **Domains**: [[might (apocryphal)](../domains.md#Might%20(apocryphal))]
- **Cast** [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**An ally within range critically succeeds at a melee [Strike](strike.md).
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**the triggering ally

Your true might comes from your bonds with your allies, and you glory in their achievements. The weapon used to make the [Strike](strike.md) deals an additional `1d6` sonic damage (not doubled due to the critical hit), and the ally can immediately attempt to [Shove](rules/actions/shove.md) the creature struck, even if the ally's hands are full.

Your ally can use its item bonus to the triggering attack roll on the [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check, if any, and it gains a +1 status bonus to the [Athletics](../skills.md#Athletics) check if the triggering [Strike](strike.md) was with a weapon that has the [trip](rules/traits/trip.md) trait or an unarmed attack that has the [trip](rules/traits/trip.md) trait.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The sonic damage increases by `1d6`.
