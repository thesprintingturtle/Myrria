- **Range**100 foot
- **Duration**

You call forth a servitor forged from raw positive energy to heal and bolster your allies. The servitor occupies the space of a Huge creature and has a speed of 60 feet.

Arrive (healing, necromancy, positive) Servitor's Protection The servitor appears in a flash of light, moving from ally to ally and granting them a temporary reprieve. All allies within 20 feet of the Servitor gain 20 temporary Hit Points until the servitor departs.

Depart (healing, necromancy, positive) Servitor's Blessing The servitor disappears in a 30-foot emanation of positive energy. All willing living creatures within heal `3d8` Hit Points. All undead within take that much damage, with a basic Fortitude save.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The Arrive effect's temporary Hit Points increase by 8, and the Depart effect's healing and damage to undead increase by `1d8`.
