- **Range**30 foot
- **Area**up to two 5-foot bursts that don't overlap

You call forth a storm of whirling flames, engulfing all creatures in that area and dealing `5d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `3d6`, and you can add another nonoverlapping 5-foot burst to the area. Ranger
