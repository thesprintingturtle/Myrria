- **11th or Lower** The target is [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) permanently.
- **12thâ€“13th** The target is [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) for `1d4` minutes.
- **14th or Higher** The target is [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The levels at which each outcome applies increase by 2.
