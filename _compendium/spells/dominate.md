# Dominate *Spell 6*   
[enchantment](enchantment.md)  [incapacitation](incapacitation.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**until the next time you make your daily preparations

You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders.

If you issue an obviously self-destructive order, the target doesn't act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) as it fights off your commands.
> - **Failure** The target follows your orders but can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.
> - **Critical Failure** As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.

**Heightened (10th)** The duration is unlimited.
