# Tempest Surge *Focus 1*   
[air](air.md)  [druid](rules/traits/druid.md)  [electricity](electricity.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

You surround a foe in a swirling storm of violent winds, roiling clouds, and crackling lightning. The storm deals `1d12` electricity damage. The target must attempt a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the target also is [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round and takes 1 [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d12`, and the [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a failure increases by 1.
