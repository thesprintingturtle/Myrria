- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You conjure a [lawful](lawful.md) [celestial](celestial.md), [monitor](monitor.md), or [fiend](fiend.md) to fight on your behalf. You summon a common lawful creature that has the [celestial](celestial.md), [monitor](monitor.md), or [fiend](fiend.md) trait and whose level is 5 or lower. You can't summon a creature unless its alignment is one of your deity's preferred alignments (or, if you don't have a deity, is within one step of your alignment). At the GM's discretion, some deities might restrict specific types of creatures, even if their alignments match. Heightening the spell increases the maximum level of creature you can summon.
