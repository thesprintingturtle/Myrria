With a rattling hiss, you create a quickly evaporating mist of [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) poisonous marsh gas to smother creatures in the area. When you [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md), the mist dissipates completely from the previous area, and you can select a new area within range to fill with the mist. If you don't [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md), the mist dissipates and the spell ends. You deal `4d6` poison damage to each breathing creature that starts its turn in the area. Each affected creature must attempt a Fortitude save. The creature is then temporarily immune to gasping marsh for 1 minute.
