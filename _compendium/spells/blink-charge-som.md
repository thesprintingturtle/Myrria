# Blink Charge *Spell 5*   
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  [force](force.md)  [teleportation](teleportation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You propel yourself through the fabric of space to deal a blow carrying the momentum of your teleportation. You teleport to an empty space adjacent to a creature you can see within range, then make a [Strike](strike.md) against the creature with a weapon you're wielding. The [Strike](strike.md) deals damage, plus an extra `2d8` force damage, depending on the result of your [Strike](strike.md).

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** Double damage, plus after the [Strike](strike.md), you can teleport the target into an empty space up to 5 feet away from its current position. The new space must be on the ground if it started on the ground, in the air if it was flying, and so on.
> - **Success** The [Strike](strike.md) deals full damage.
> - **Failure** The [Strike](strike.md) deals no damage, but the target takes `1d8` force damage.
> - **Critical Failure** The [Strike](strike.md) deals no damage, and you take `1d8` force damage.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The spell's range increases by 60 feet, and any force damage the spell deals is increased by `1d8`.
