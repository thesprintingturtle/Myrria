[cantrip](cantrip.md)  [divination](divination.md)  [hex](hex-apg.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  [witch](rules/traits/witch-apg.md)  

- **Patron** Witch
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Duration**sustained up to 1 minute

You call upon your patron's power to better uncover secrets.

When you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md), the target can [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md), [Seek](seek.md), or [Sense Motive](sense-motive.md). The target gains a +1 status bonus to the skill or [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) used for the roll, and this bonus remains as long as you [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md). The target is temporarily immune to discern secrets for 1 minute.

**Heightened (5th)** You can target two creatures instead of one.
