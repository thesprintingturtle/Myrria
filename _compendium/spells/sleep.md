# Sleep *Spell 1*   
[enchantment](enchantment.md)  [incapacitation](incapacitation.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Area**5-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Will

Each creature in the area becomes drowsy and might fall asleep. A creature that falls [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) from this spell doesn't fall [prone](conditions.md#Prone) or release what it's holding. This spell doesn't prevent creatures from waking up due to a successful [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check, limiting its utility in combat.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes a â€“1 status penalty to [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The creature falls [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious). If it's still [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature falls [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious). If it's still [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically.

**Heightened (4th)** The creatures fall [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) for 1 round on a failure or 1 minute on a critical failure. They fall [prone](conditions.md#Prone) and release what they're holding, and they can't attempt [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to wake up. When the duration ends, the creature is sleeping normally instead of automatically waking up.
