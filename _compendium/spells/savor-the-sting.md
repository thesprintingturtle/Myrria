# Savor The Sting *Focus 1*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [nonlethal](nonlethal.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[pain](../setting/domains.md#Pain)]
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

You inflict pain upon the target and revel in their anguish. This deals `1d4` mental damage and `1d4` [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage); the target must attempt a Will save. As long as the target is taking [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this spell, you gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and skill checks against the target.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half damage and no [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The target takes full initial and [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The target takes double initial and [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The initial damage increases by `1d4` and the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by `1d4`.
