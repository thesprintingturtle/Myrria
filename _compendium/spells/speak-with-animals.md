# Speak With Animals *Spell 2*   
[divination](divination.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**10 minutes

You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the [Diplomacy](../skills.md#Diplomacy) skill with animals. The spell doesn't make them more [friendly](conditions.md#Friendly) than normal. Cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones often make inane comments.
