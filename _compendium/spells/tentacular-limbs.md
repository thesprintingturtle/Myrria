# Tentacular Limbs *Focus 1*   
[morph](morph.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

Your arms turn into long, pliable tentacles, increasing your reach when you're delivering touch range spells and making unarmed [Strikes](strike.md) with your arms (such as fist and claw [Strikes](strike.md)) to 10 feet. This doesn't change the reach of your melee weapon attacks. During the duration, whenever you [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md), you can add an additional action to that spell's casting to temporarily extend your reach to 20 feet to deliver that spell.

**Heightened (+ 2)** When you add an additional action to a spell to temporarily extend your reach, your reach increases by an additional 10 feet to deliver that spell.
