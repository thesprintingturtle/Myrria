# Acid Arrow *Spell 2*   
[acid](acid.md)  [attack](attack.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You conjure an arrow of acid that continues corroding the target after it hits. Make a spell attack against the target.

On a hit, you deal `3d8` acid damage plus `1d6` [persistent acid damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The initial damage increases by 2d8, and the [persistent acid damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1d6.
