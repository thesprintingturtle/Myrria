# Perfected Mind *Focus 1*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[perfection](../domains.md#Perfection)]
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

You meditate upon perfection to remove all distractions from your mind. Attempt a new Will save against one [mental](mental.md) effect currently affecting you that required a Will save. Use the result of this new save to determine the outcome of the [mental](mental.md) effect, unless the new save would have a worse result than the original save, in which case nothing happens. You can use perfected mind against a given effect only once.
