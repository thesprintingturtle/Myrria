[divination](divination.md)  [linguistic](linguistic.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**10 minutes

You can communicate telepathically with creatures within 30 feet. Once you establish a connection by communicating with a creature, the communication is two-way. You can communicate only with creatures that share a language with you.

**Heightened (6th)** Telepathy loses the [linguistic](linguistic.md) trait. You can communicate telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language.
