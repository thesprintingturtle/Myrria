# Symphony Of The Unfettered Heart *Focus 5*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [bard](rules/traits/bard.md)  [composition](composition.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**you or 1 ally

Your symphony lifts listeners from their worldly concerns.

Attempt a [Performance](../skills.md#Performance) check to counteract one of the following conditions affecting the target: [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed), [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized), [paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed), [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained), [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed), or [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned). If you fail, you can't target that effect on the target for 1 day. Use the condition's source to determine the counteract DC (for example, the [Escape](escape.md) DC for [grabbed](conditions.md#Grabbed)).

**Heightened (9th)** You can target up to four creatures.
