# Mirror's Misfortune *Spell 4*   
[illusion](illusion.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You split into your real self and a mirrored version of yourself that curses would-be attackers with misfortune on their next attacks. When you cast this spell, you seem to split in two. As you do, you can [Step](step.md) to any adjacent square. In either your initial square, or another square adjacent to your initial square, an exact illusory duplicate of you appears. You decide a simple course of action for the duplicate to follow, such as to walk to a specific point or wave its hands in the air, but more complex routines are beyond its abilities. A creature can distinguish between you and the duplicate only if it spends an action to [Seek](seek.md) and succeeds at a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check against the spell's DC.

If a creature takes a [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) action against the duplicate, the illusion shatters into mirrorlike shards, inflicting bad luck on the attacker's next few attacks as misfortune's toll for shattering the mirror. The attacker must attempt a Will save with the following effects; this is a [curse](curse.md) and [misfortune](misfortune.md) effect. When the duplicate shatters, the spell ends.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** Within the next hour, the creature must roll its next two attack rolls twice and take the lower result.
> - **Critical Failure** Within the next hour, the creature must roll its next four attack rolls twice and take the lower result.
