# Glitterdust *Spell 2*   
[evocation](evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**10-foot burst
- **Saving Throw** Reflex

Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust. Each creature must attempt a Reflex save. If a creature has its invisibility negated by this spell, it is [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) instead of [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible). This applies both if the creature was already [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) and if it benefits from new invisibility effects before the end of the invisibility negation effect from this spell.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.

> - **Critical Failure** The target is [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round and [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) for 10 minutes. Its invisibility is negated for 10 minutes.
