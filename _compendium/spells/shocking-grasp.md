You shroud your hands in a crackling field of lightning. Make a melee spell attack roll. On a hit, the target takes `2d12` electricity damage. If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll with shocking grasp, and the target also takes `1d4` [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on a hit. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d12`, and the [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by 1.
