# Hero's Defiance *Focus 10*   
[champion](rules/traits/champion.md)  [healing](healing.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [positive](positive.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [F](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Free Action") 
- **Trigger**An attack would bring you to 0 Hit Points.

You shout in defiance, filling you with a sudden burst of healing.

Just before applying the attack's damage, you recover `10d4+20` Hit Points. If this is enough to prevent the attack from bringing you to 0 Hit Points, you don't become [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) or [dying](conditions.md#Dying).

Either way, cheating death is difficult, and you can't use hero's defiance again until you [Refocus](refocus.md) or the next time you prepare.

Hero's defiance cannot be used against effects with the [death](death.md) trait or that would leave no remains, such as [disintegrate](compendium/spells/disintegrate.md).
