[polymorph](polymorph.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Domains**: [[swarm](../domains.md#Swarm)]
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**5 minutes

You discorporate into a swarm of Tiny creatures. While in swarm form, you have the [swarm](swarm-b1.md) trait and you gain resistance 5 to slashing and piercing damage and weakness 5 to area and splash damage. You can fit into spaces only a few inches wide, moving your constituent creatures through the gap.

You don't gain the swarm mind ability, so you are still affected normally by [mental](mental.md) effects. As a swarm, you can't speak, cast spells, use manipulate actions requiring your hands, activate your magic items, or make any of your [Strikes](strike.md) with your normal body. You can [Dismiss](dismiss.md) the Spell.

**Heightened (+ 2)** Increase your resistances and weaknesses each by 5.
