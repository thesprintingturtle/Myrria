# Moonlight Ray *Spell 3*   
[attack](attack.md)  [cold](cold.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [good](good.md)  [light](rules/traits/light.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You unleash a holy beam of freezing moonlight. Make a ranged spell attack. The ray deals `5d6` cold damage; if the target is a fiend or undead, you deal an extra `5d6` good damage. Moonlight ray's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes double cold damage, as well as double good damage if a fiend or undead.
> - **Success** The target takes full damage. If the light passes through an area of magical darkness or targets a creature affected by magical darkness, moonlight ray attempts to counteract the darkness. If you need to determine whether the light passes through an area of darkness, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage increases by `2d6`, and the good damage against fiends and undead increases by `2d6`.
