# Animus Mine *Spell 2*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 hour

You implant a mental mine within your psyche that detonates against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts[^1]. You can use a single action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait, to suppress the effects of the mine for 1 round to allow someone to safely use a [mental](mental.md) effect on you. You can [Dismiss](dismiss.md) the spell.

The first creature that uses a [magical](magical.md) [mental](mental.md) effect against you triggers the animus mine, causing the spell to end. The animus mine deals `4d8` mental damage to the triggering creature, which must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage and is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned). You are unaffected by the triggering [mental](mental.md) effect.

[^1]: The animus mine spell should only the deal the mental damage on [magical](magical.md) [mental](mental.md) effects that send their magic into your mind, not if a creature tries to do something mundane like talk to you. (Lost Omens Gods & Magic Errata (https://paizo.com/pathfinder/faq))

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d8`.
