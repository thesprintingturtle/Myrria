Falsehoods pass your lips as smoothly as silk. You gain a +4 status bonus to [Deception](../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Lie](lie.md) and against [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) checks to discern if you are telling the truth, and you add your level even if you're untrained. If the implausibility of your lies prompts a circumstance penalty or a DC increase, reduce that penalty or increase by half.
