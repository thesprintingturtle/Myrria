# Flesh To Stone *Spell 6*   
[transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature made of flesh
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude
- **Duration**varies

You try to turn the target's flesh into stone. The target must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) and must attempt a Fortitude save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the [incapacitation](incapacitation.md) trait. On a failed save, the [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) condition increases by 1 (or 2 on a critical failure). A successful save reduces the [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) condition by 1. When a creature is unable to act due to the slowed condition from flesh to stone, the creature is permanently non-magically [petrified](conditions.md#Petrified). The spell ends if the creature is [petrified](conditions.md#Petrified) or the [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) condition is removed.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is initially [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed).
