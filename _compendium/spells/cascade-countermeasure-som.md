# Cascade Countermeasure *Focus 3*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Requirements**You're benefiting from [Arcane Cascade](arcane-cascade-som.md).
- **Duration**until the [Arcane Cascade](arcane-cascade-som.md) stance ends

You quickly adjust your Arcane Cascade to offer magical protection. You gain resistance 5 against damage from spells. As normal, using Arcane Cascade again means you've ended the stance, and the spell ends.

**Heightened (+ 3)** The resistance increases by 5.
