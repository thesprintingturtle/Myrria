- **Domains**: [[knowledge](../domains.md#Knowledge)]
- **Cast** [R](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction") 
- **Trigger**You attempt a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check to [Seek](seek.md), or you attempt a skill check to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) with a skill you're trained in.

Speaking a short prayer as you gather your thoughts, you're blessed to find that your deity gave you just the right bit of information for your situation. Roll the triggering check twice and use the better result.
