# Grease *Spell 1*   
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Area**4 contiguous 5-foot squares or
- **Targets**1 object of 1 Bulk or less

You conjure grease, with effects based on choosing area or target.

- **Area** All solid ground in the area is covered with grease. Each creature standing on the greasy surface must succeed at a Reflex save or an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check against your spell DC or fall [prone](conditions.md#Prone). Creatures using an action to move onto the greasy surface during the spell's duration must attempt either a Reflex save or an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check to [Balance](balance.md). A creature that [Steps](step.md) or Crawls doesn't have to attempt a check or save.
- **Target** If you cast the spell on an unattended object, anyone trying to pick up the object must succeed at an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check or Reflex save against your spell DC to do so. If you target an attended object, the creature that has the object must attempt an [Acrobatics](../skills.md#Acrobatics) check or Reflex save. On a failure, the holder or wielder takes a â€“2 circumstance penalty to all checks that involve using the object; on a critical failure, the holder or wielder releases the item. The object lands in an adjacent square of the GM's choice

If you cast this spell on a worn object, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against attempts to grapple them.
