[auditory](auditory.md)  [emotion](emotion.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will

A heap of insults and invectives spew from your mouthâ€” words so devastating your foes burn from the intensity of your diatribe. Your words deal `2d6` [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and the target must attempt a Will save. If the target doesn't understand the language or you're not speaking a language, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half the [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The target becomes [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) and takes the full [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The target becomes [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) and takes double the [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 2)** You can target two additional creatures, and the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by `2d6`.
