# Spiritual Anamnesis *Spell 4*   
[mental](mental.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

Memories of a past life that seem incredibly real (and may even be) overwhelm the target's mind. This is especially disorienting for undead and creatures that have lived a previous life (such as celestials, fiends, monitors, and many other extraplanar creatures); if such creatures roll a critical success on their save, they get a success instead, and if they roll a failure, they get a critical failure instead.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute and babbles about the visions, possibly providing information about what they saw.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is also [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).
