You necrotize part of a creature's body, harming it and debilitating it as its body putrefies, mimicking the natural process of decay. The target takes `12d6` negative damage and one of the following debilitations; roll `1d4` to randomly determine which. The effects depend on its Fortitude save.

- **Bones** The target's bones necrotize and become spongy and weak, giving it weakness 3 to bludgeoning damage.
- **Joints** The target's joints necrotize, making its movements ungainly and [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy). It becomes [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy).
- **Legs** The target's legs necrotize, as well as any other limbs associated with forms of movement, making it harder for the creature to move. The target takes a â€“10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.
- **Muscles** The target's muscles necrotize, rotting away. The target becomes [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled).
