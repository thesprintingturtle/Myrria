- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

Siphoning negative energy into yourself, your hand radiates a pale darkness. Your touch weakens the living and disorients undead, possibly even causing them to flee. The effect depends on whether the target is living or undead.

- **Living Creature** The spell deals negative damage equal to `1d4` plus your spellcasting modifier. The target attempts a basic Fortitude save, but is also [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 round on a critical failure.
- **Undead Creature** The target is [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round on a failed Fortitude save. On a critical failure, the target is also [fleeing](conditions.md#Fleeing) for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The negative damage to living creatures increases by `1d4`.
