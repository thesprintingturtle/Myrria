# Shielding Strike *Focus 1*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [magus](rules/traits/magus-som.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

As you attack a foe, warding magic transforms your momentum into action and lifts your shield. Make a melee [Strike](strike.md). You can then either [Raise your Shield](raise-a-shield.md) if you're wielding one or cast [shield](compendium/spells/shield.md) if you have the spell.
