# Isolation *Focus 4*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [illusion](illusion.md)  [rare](rare.md)  

- **Domains**: [[darkness (apocryphal)](../setting/domains.md#Darkness%20(apocryphal))]
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**3 rounds

You summon a tangible manifestation of loneliness to cloak the target from view as surely as if it were wreathed in darkness. The target attempts a Will saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target becomes [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible), but only to its allies. Any creature not allied with the target can see it normally. Effects such as [see invisibility](see-invisibility.md) enable an ally to see the target. The target's allies still know the target is present and can still see all the effects of the target's actions.
> - **Failure** As success, except the target also becomes inaudible to its allies and imperceptible to them through any other senses.
