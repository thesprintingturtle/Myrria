You call upon the unimaginable power of world-ending cataclysms, ripping a small piece of each cataclysm and combining them together into one horrifically powerful attack.

The following effects come down upon all creatures in the area. Treat the resistances of creatures in the area as if they were 10 lower for the purpose of determining the cataclysm's damage. Each creature attempts one basic Reflex save that applies to all six types of damage.

- Flesh-dissolving acid rain deals `3d10` acid damage.
- A roaring earthquake shakes and bludgeons creatures on the ground, dealing `3d10` bludgeoning damage.
- A blast of freezing wind deals `3d10` cold damage.
- Incredible lightning lashes the area, dealing `3d10` electricity damage.
- Beating winds churn across the sky, dealing `3d10` bludgeoning damage to creatures flying in the area.
- An instant tsunami sweeps over creatures in the area, dealing `3d10` bludgeoning damage with the [water](water.md) trait (doubled for creatures swimming in the area).
- A massive wildfire burns in a sudden inferno, dealing `3d10` fire damage.
