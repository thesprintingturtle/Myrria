- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**varies
- **Targets**1 or more creatures

Gathering kinetic energy, you either focus it in a straight line or disperse it as an encircling ripple. Any creature targeted by this spell must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you (or 20 feet on a critical failure). The spell's area or range and how many creatures it affects is based on how many actions you spend when Casting the Spell.

[>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") The spell targets one creature within 15 feet.

[>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") The spell targets one creature within 30 feet. The distance the target is pushed if it fails is doubled, and on a critical failure, the target is also knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone) and takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage.

[>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") The spell targets all creatures in a 5-foot emanation.
