# Restoration *Spell 2*   
[healing](healing.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** 1 minute 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature

Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast [restoration](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/restoration.md), choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one [restoration](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/restoration.md) spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.

- **Reduce a Condition** Reduce the value of the target's [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy), [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled), or [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.
- **Lessen a Toxin** Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.

**Heightened (4th)** Add [drained](conditions.md#Drained) to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) condition.

**Heightened (6th)** As the 4th-level [restoration](../../../..//TTRPGShare-Pathfinder-2E-Vault/compendium/spells/restoration.md), but you can reduce a permanent [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while [Casting the Spell](cast-a-spell.md), during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.
