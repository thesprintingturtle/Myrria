# Incendiary Aura *Focus 1*   
[cursebound](cursebound-apg.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [fire](fire.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**10-foot emanation
- **Duration**1 minute

You surround yourself with a combustible aura. Each time a creature within the emanation takes fire damage, it catches on fire, taking `2d4` [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

**Heightened (+ 2)** Increase the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) by `1d4` and the radius of the emanation by 5 feet.
