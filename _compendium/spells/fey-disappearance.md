# Fey Disappearance *Focus 3*   
[enchantment](enchantment.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Duration**until the end of your next turn

You become [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) and ignore natural difficult terrain (such as underbrush). Any [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) action you use ends this invisibility, but you still ignore natural difficult terrain.

**Heightened (5th)** If you use a [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) action, the invisibility doesn't end.
