You create an illusory duplicate of the target creature by animating ice or snow sculpted in its shape. The simulacrum is a 4th-level creature with no special abilities. If it needs to attempt a roll or use a DC, use the moderate number for a monster, except as noted below. It doesn't have any specific memories from the target, but it can use information about the creature gained from any of the casters to [Impersonate](impersonate.md) the target. It looks exactly like the target and has a [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) modifier to [Impersonate](impersonate.md) that creature equal to the modifier of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) check, with a +4 status bonus.

While it doesn't have any of the original's special abilities, like a dragon's breath weapon, the illusions that make up the simulacrum allow it to appear to use those abilities; they just never seem to have an effect. For instance, against a simulacrum dragon's breath weapon, all creatures in the area seem to critically succeed at their saving throws and take no damage. Creatures can attempt to 0 by attempting a [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check against the [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) DC of the secondary spellcaster who rolled the [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) check.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** You bring the simulacrum to life. It has the [minion](minion.md) trait and is under your absolute control. You gain a direct mental link with the simulacrum and can spend an action to command the simulacrum via this link, even at a distance.
> - **Success** As a critical success, but there is no special link between you and the simulacrum. You must spend an action to command it verbally or by some other means.
> - **Failure** The ritual fails and has no effect.
> - **Critical Failure** The simulacrum awakens, but it isn't your [minion](minion.md) and is [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) to all the casters. It does everything it can to destroy them, but if it can't immediately slay them, the simulacrum tries to escape and plots their demise.
