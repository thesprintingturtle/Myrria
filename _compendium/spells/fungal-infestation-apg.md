# Fungal Infestation *Spell 2*   
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Area**15-foot cone
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

Toxic spores swarm over creatures in the area, causing them to erupt in grotesque fungal growths. These noxious growths deal `2d6` [persistent poison damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and each creature must attempt a Fortitude save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes half the [persistent poison damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Failure** The target takes the full [persistent poison damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). While it is taking this [persistent poison damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), it has weakness 1 to fire and weakness 1 to slashing.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but double the [persistent poison damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). While it is taking this [persistent poison damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), it has weakness 2 to fire and weakness 2 to slashing.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) increases by `2d6`, and the weakness increases by 1, or by 2 on a critical failure.
