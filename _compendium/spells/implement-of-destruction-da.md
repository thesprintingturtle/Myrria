# Implement of Destruction *Spell 4*   
[emotion](emotion.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 enemy, and 1 weapon that is either unattended or wielded by you or a willing ally
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

You solemnly declare that the target weapon will bring death to a foe, implanting an irrational fear of the weapon into the target enemy. This link echoes at the forefront of the enemy's mind, forming a looming sense of omnipresent dread. The effect is based on the target enemy's Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target enemy is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target weapon deals an additional `2d6` mental damage the first time it hits the target enemy before the end of the spell's duration.
> - **Failure** The target weapon deals an additional `2d6` [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed) for as long as it takes this [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
> - **Critical Failure** The target weapon deals an additional `4d6` [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) to the target enemy. If the enemy is critically hit by the weapon, the enemy is [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed).

**Heightened (+ 2)** Increase the mental damage by `1d6` on a success, and increase the [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) by `1d6` on a failure or by `2d6` on a critical failure.
