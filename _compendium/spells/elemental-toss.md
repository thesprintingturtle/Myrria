# Elemental Toss *Focus 1*   
[attack](attack.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

With a flick of your wrist, you fling a chunk of your elemental matter at your foe. Make a spell attack roll, dealing `1d8` bludgeoning damage (or fire damage if your element is fire) on a success, and double damage on a critical success. This spell has your element's trait.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d8`.
