You override a target's olfactory senses, luring them to a specific location through tantalizing false scents. Select a single square within range that is not hazardous or occupied by a creature. The target is drawn to the selected location, becoming euphoric upon arrival. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target is distracted by the tantalizing scents, becoming [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round.
> - **Failure** The target is [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) and moves toward the selected location via the most direct route possible for 1 round, bypassing any obvious hazards and enemies in the way.
> - **Critical Failure** The target is [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) and moves to the selected location via the most direct route possible for 1 round, bypassing any obvious hazards and enemies in the way. If the creature reaches the destination, it must remain in that location for `1d4` rounds but can otherwise act normally.

**Heightened (+ 2)** You target 1 additional creature, selecting a different square within range as their destination.
