# Vigilant Eye *Focus 4*   
[divination](divination.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  [wizard](rules/traits/wizard.md)  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**500 foot
- **Duration**1 hour

You create an [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) eye sensor, as [clairvoyance](compendium/spells/clairvoyance.md).

When created, this eye must be in your line of sight. When the spell's duration ends, you can spend 1 Focus Point as a free action to extend the duration for another hour, though as normal, it ends immediately during your next daily preparations.
