# Entangle *Spell 2*   
[plant](plant.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Area**all squares in a 20-foot burst that contain plants or fungi
- **Duration**1 minute

Plants or fungi in the area entangle creatures. The area counts as difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in the area, it must attempt a Reflex save. On a failure, it takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it leaves the area, and on a critical failure, it is also [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized) for 1 round. Creatures can attempt to [Escape](escape.md) at entangle's DC to remove these effects.
