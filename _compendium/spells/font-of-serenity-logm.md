# Font Of Serenity *Focus 4*   
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [emotion](emotion.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

- **Domains**: [[repose](../domains.md#Repose)]
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Area**15-foot emanation
- **Duration**1 minute

A divine beacon radiates serenity, soothing nearby allies.

Allies within the area gain a +1 status bonus to saving throws against [emotion](emotion.md) effects. An ally can touch the font as an [Interact](interact.md) action; if they do so, the spell attempts to counteract one [emotion](emotion.md) effect affecting the ally of the ally's choice, after which that [emotion](emotion.md) effect is temporarily immune for 1 day.

If the spell succeeds at the counteract check, it removes the [emotion](emotion.md) effect from your ally, though not from any other creatures the effect might be affecting.

**Heightened (+ 4)** The bonus increases by 1.
