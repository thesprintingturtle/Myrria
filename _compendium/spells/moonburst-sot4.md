A powerful globe of chilling moonlight explodes in the area, dealing `8d10` cold damage to creatures and objects in the area, plus `8d10` additional positive damage to undead creatures. Moonburst's cold damage is silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. Each creature and object in the area must attempt a Reflex save.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage increases by `1d10`, and the positive damage against undead increases by `1d10`.
