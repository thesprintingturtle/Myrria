# Daze *Cantrip 1*   
[cantrip](cantrip.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [nonlethal](nonlethal.md)

- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 round

You cloud the target's mind and daze it with a mental jolt.

The jolt deals mental damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; the target must attempt a basic Will save. If the target critically fails the save, it is also [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned).

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
