> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** For 1 round, the creature can't use reactions and must attempt another save at the start of its turn; on a failure, it is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for that turn as it sobs uncontrollably.
> - **Failure** As success, but the [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) duration is 1 minute.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the creature is automatically [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute.
