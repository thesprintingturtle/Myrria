# Haunting Hymn *Cantrip 1*   
[auditory](auditory.md)  [cantrip](cantrip.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [sonic](sonic.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot cone
- **Saving Throw** Fortitude

You echo a jarring hymn that only creatures in the area can hear. The hymn deals sonic damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier, with a basic Fortitude save. If a target critically fails the save, it's also [deafened](conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
