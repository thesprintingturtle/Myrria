# Rip The Spirit *Spell 5*   
[death](death.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [negative](negative.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 living creature
- **Saving Throw**  basic Fortitude

You supernaturally rip the spirit from a living creature's body, dooming the target to pain and death. The target takes `5d6` negative damage, depending on its basic Fortitude save, and is [drained](conditions.md#Drained) if it fails its save. The spell's effect is based on how many actions you spend when [Casting the Spell](cast-a-spell.md).

**[>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") (somatic)** The spell targets one living creature in range.

**[>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (somatic, verbal)** The spell targets one living creature in range and the damage is `10d6` negative instead of `5d6`.

**[>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (material, somatic, verbal)** The spell targets all living creatures in a 30-foot emanation.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of damage increases by `1d6`, or by `2d6` for the 2-action version.
