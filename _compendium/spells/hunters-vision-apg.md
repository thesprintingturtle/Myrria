# Hunter's Vision *Focus 5*   
[divination](divination.md)  [ranger](rules/traits/ranger.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 hunted prey
- **Duration**10 minutes

Your target glows with a magical aura visible only to you and those who follow your lead. Your target is visible to you and others sharing your [Hunt Prey](hunt-prey.md) benefits even if it wouldn't normally be due to lighting or the [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) or [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) conditions, though cover from opaque objects still blocks your sight. You ignore the flat check against the target due to the [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) condition, and the target isn't automatically [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from you due to darkness or being [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible).
