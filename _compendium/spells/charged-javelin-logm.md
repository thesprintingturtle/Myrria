You fire a javelin of electricity that leaves a charged field around its target. Make a spell attack roll. The javelin deals `1d6` electricity damage and 1 [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

> - **Success** The javelin deals full damage. As long as the target is taking [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from this spell, creatures gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls with metal weapons or [electricity](electricity.md) effects against the target, and the target takes a â€“1 status penalty to saves against [electricity](electricity.md) effects.
