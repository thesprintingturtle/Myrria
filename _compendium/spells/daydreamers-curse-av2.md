# Daydreamer's Curse *Spell 4*   
[attack](attack.md)  [curse](curse.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [misfortune](misfortune.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You impose a curse upon the target that renders it easily distracted and unable to focus its thoughts on tasks that demand insight or discernment. The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** For 10 minutes, the target must roll twice and use the worse result whenever attempting a [Medicine](../skills.md#Medicine), [Nature](../skills.md#Nature), [Perception](../skills.md#Perception), or [Survival](../skills.md#Survival) check. If the target critically succeeds at a [Perception](../skills.md#Perception) check or skill check to perform an action with the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait, the target gets a success instead.
> - **Failure** As success, but the effect is permanent.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the target treats the outcomes of all checks with the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait as one degree of success worse than the result it rolled (a critical success becomes a success, a success becomes a failure, and a failure becomes a critical failure).
