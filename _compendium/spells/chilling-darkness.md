# Chilling Darkness *Spell 3*   
[attack](attack.md)  [cold](cold.md)  [darkness](rules/traits/darkness.md)  [evil](evil.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You shoot an utterly cold ray of darkness tinged with unholy energy. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. You deal `5d6` cold damage, plus `5d6` evil damage if the target is a celestial.

If the ray passes through an area of magical light or targets a creature affected by magical light, chilling darkness attempts to counteract the light. If you need to determine whether the ray passes through an area of light, draw a line between yourself and the spell's target.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target takes double damage.
> - **Success** The target takes full damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The cold damage increases by `2d6`, and the evil damage against celestials increases by `2d6`.
