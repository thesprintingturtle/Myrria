You combine a blazing inferno and air currents into a fiery vortex. You can [Cast this Spell](cast-a-spell.md) only if you are outside or the ceiling is 40 feet or higher. All squares in the vortex are difficult terrain for flying creatures.

All creatures in the area take `3d4` bludgeoning damage and `3d6` fire damage as gusts of fiery wind buffet them, with a basic Reflex save. Each time you [Sustain the Spell](sustain-a-spell.md), you can move the whirlwind up to 20 feet in a straight line. Each creature the whirlwind moves through takes the damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature can take damage from a flame vortex only once per round.

**Heightened (+ 2)** The vortex deals an additional `1d4` bludgeoning damage and `1d6` fire damage.
