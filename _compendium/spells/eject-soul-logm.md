# Eject Soul *Focus 1*   
[incapacitation](incapacitation.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  

- **Domains**: [[souls](../setting/domains.md#Souls)]
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Targets**1 living creature that has a soul

Your touch disrupts the connection between body and soul, possibly forcing the soul out of the body altogether. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. You can allow allies to choose the degree of success instead of rolling a saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) as its soul briefly loses its connection to its body.
> - **Critical Failure** The target's soul exits its body for 1 round. The target's body becomes [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned). While its body is [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) in this way, the target remains fully aware in soul form; it simply can't consciously move its body (though the body makes basic instinctual defensive movements). The target's soul has the [incorporeal](incorporeal-b1.md) trait, is [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible), and has a fly Speed of 60 feet. It can't attack, cast spells, or attempt any skill checks that require a physical body, and it must always maintain line of effect to its body. When the target's body ceases being [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned), the target's soul instantly returns to its body as the target wakes.

**Heightened (+ 3)** If a willing ally chooses to critically fail, it can stay in soul form for 1 additional round.
