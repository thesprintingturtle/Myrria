# Final Sacrifice *Spell 2*   
[evocation](evocation.md)  [fire](fire.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [divine](divine.md), [occult](occult.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**120 foot
- **Targets**1 creature with the minion trait that you summoned or permanently control

You channel disruptive energies through the bond between you and your minion, causing it to violently explode. The target is immediately slain, and creatures within 20 feet of it take `6d6` fire damage (basic Reflex save)

If the target has the [cold](cold.md) or [water](water.md) trait, the spell instead deals cold damage and gains the [cold](cold.md) trait in place of the [fire](fire.md) trait. If used on a creature that isn't mindless, this spell has the [evil](evil.md) trait. Attempting to cast this spell targeting a creature that you temporarily seized control of, such as an undead commanded by command undead, automatically fails and breaks the controlling effect.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d6`.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
