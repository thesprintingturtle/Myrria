You hurl a loose, unattended object that is within range and that has 1 Bulk or less at the target. Make a spell attack roll against the target. If you hit, you deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage—as appropriate for the object you hurled—equal to `1d6` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

No specific traits or magic properties of the hurled item affect the attack or the damage.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `1d6`.
