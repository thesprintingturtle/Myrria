# Unseasonable Squall *Spell 3*   
[air](air.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**60 foot
- **Area**20-foot burst
- **Duration**until the start of your next turn

You issue a blast of sudden wind that ripples outward from the center of the burst. The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, scatters objects of light Bulk or less, and pushes unsecured objects of 1 Bulk or less 5 feet away from the spell's origin point. Each Medium or smaller creature in the area when you [Cast the Spell](cast-a-spell.md) or that moves into spell's area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The creature is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone). If the creature was Flying, it gets a critical failure instead.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is pushed 30 feet away from the center of the burst, is knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone), and takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage.
