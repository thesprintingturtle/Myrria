# Flowing Strike *Spell 5*   
[evocation](evocation.md)  [water](water.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 

A wave of flowing water rushes behind you like an elegant river, pushing you across the battlefield with fluid grace.

You [Stride](stride.md) up to 50 feet. This movement doesn't trigger reactions. You can make a [Strike](strike.md) at any point during your [Stride](stride.md). If your [Strike](strike.md) hits, the wave flows after you to batter the target of your [Strike](strike.md) as well, dealing `2d10` bludgeoning damage and pushing it 10 feet in a direction of your choice.

**Spell Lists**: Elemental
