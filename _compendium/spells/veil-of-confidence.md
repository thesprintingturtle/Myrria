# Veil Of Confidence *Focus 1*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Domains**: [[confidence](../setting/domains.md#Confidence)]
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You surround yourself in a veil of confidence. You reduce your current [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition by 1, and whenever you would become [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) during the duration, reduce the amount by 1. If you critically fail a save against fear, veil of confidence ends immediately, and you increase any [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition you gain from the critical failure by 1 instead of decreasing it.
