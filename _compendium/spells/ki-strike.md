# Ki Strike *Focus 1*   
[monk](rules/traits/monk.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") 

You focus your ki into magical attacks. Make an unarmed [Strike](strike.md) or [Flurry of Blows](flurry-of-blows.md) (this doesn't change the limit on using only one flourish per turn). You gain a +1 status bonus to your attack rolls with the [Strikes](strike.md), and the [Strikes](strike.md) deal `1d6` extra damage. This damage can be any of the following types of your choice, chosen each time you [Strike](strike.md): force, lawful (only if you're lawful), negative, or positive.

**Heightened (+ 4)** The extra damage increases by `1d6`.
