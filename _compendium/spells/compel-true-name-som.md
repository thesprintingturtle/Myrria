- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature whose true name you know
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**varies

You instruct the target to do something, compelling obedience by calling it by its true name. Your instructions can't be self-destructive. Though this spell has the [linguistic](linguistic.md) trait, this applies only to the instructions; the creature doesn't need to know its own true name to be affected.

The target must attempt a Will saving throw.

> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the spell's duration is 8 hours, and the creature is not temporarily immune.
