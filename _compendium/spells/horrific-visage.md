[emotion](emotion.md)  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md)  [illusion](illusion.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [sorcerer](rules/traits/sorcerer.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  [visual](visual.md)  

- **Bloodline** Sorcerer
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**30-foot-radius emanation centered on you
- **Saving Throw** Will

You briefly transform your features into the horrific visage of a hag, striking fear into your enemies. Foes in the area must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The foe is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The foe is [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened).
> - **Critical Failure** The foe is [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened).

**Heightened (5th)** Foes in the area are [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) on a success, [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) on a failure, and [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) and [fleeing](conditions.md#Fleeing) for 1 round on a critical failure. They are still unaffected on a critical success.
