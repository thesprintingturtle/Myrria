# Perseis's Precautions *Spell 3*   
[divination](divination.md)  [fortune](fortune.md)  [prediction](prediction.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**touch
- **Duration**10 minutes

Leaving nothing to chance, you weave divinatory precautions against an ambush, alerting the target to danger. Once during the duration of this spell, the target can roll one [Perception](../skills.md#Perception), [Arcana](../skills.md#Arcana), [Crafting](../skills.md#Crafting), [Lore](../skills.md#Lore), [Occultism](../skills.md#Occultism), or [Society](../skills.md#Society) initiative roll twice and take the better result, after which the spell ends.

The strain of staying so prepared is too much for a mind to handle for long; the target is temporarily immune to this spell for 24 hours once the spell ends, whether they used the initiative benefit or not.
