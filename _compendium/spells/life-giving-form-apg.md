# Life-giving Form *Focus 6*   
[cursebound](cursebound-apg.md)  [healing](healing.md)  [light](rules/traits/light.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [oracle](rules/traits/oracle-apg.md)  [positive](positive.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Mystery** Oracle
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Duration**1 minute

You transcend your physical form, becoming a beacon of healing energy. Your body exudes bright light like a torch.

You gain resistance 5 to precision damage and weakness 5 to negative damage, and your unarmed [Strikes](strike.md) deal an extra `1d4` positive damage.

You can touch a living creature with an [Interact](interact.md) action to restore `6d8` Hit Points to it, and when a creature touches you with an [Interact](interact.md) action you can allow it to gain the same healing; either way, the creature becomes temporarily immune to life-giving form's healing for 1 minute. This is a positive [healing](healing.md) effect. You can't heal yourself with life-giving form. A creature harmed by positive damage (such as an undead) that touches you or damages you with an unarmed attack or non-reach melee weapon instead takes `3d4` positive damage, and it doesn't become temporarily immune.

You can [Dismiss](dismiss.md) this spell.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the Hit Points restored with an [Interact](interact.md) action by `1d8`, the positive damage by 1, and the resistance and weakness by 1.
