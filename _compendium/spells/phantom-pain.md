# Phantom Pain *Spell 1*   
[illusion](illusion.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [nonlethal](nonlethal.md)  

- **Traditions**: [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

Illusory pain wracks the target, dealing `2d4` mental damage and `1d4` [persistent mental damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The target must attempt a Will save.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Success** The target takes full initial damage but no [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and the spell ends immediately.
> - **Failure** The target takes full initial and [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and the target is [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened). If the target recovers from being [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened), the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) ends and the spell ends.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, but the target is [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened).

**Heightened (+ 1)** The damage increases by `2d4` and the [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) by `1d4`.
