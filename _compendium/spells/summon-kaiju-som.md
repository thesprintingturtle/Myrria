You briefly conjure a kaiju, a massive, rampaging monster with a unique name and legendary reputation.

It rises from its secluded lair to annihilate your foes. The summoned kaiju occupies the space of a [Gargantuan](gargantuan-b1.md) creature. When you [Cast this Spell](cast-a-spell.md), choose one of the kaiju below to summon.

- **Agmazar the Star Titan** Speed 100 feet, climb 50 feet; **Arrive** ([necromancy](necromancy.md), [negative](negative.md)) _Channel Void_ Each foe in a 100-foot emanation takes `16d8` negative energy damage with a basic Fortitude save; **Depart** ([transmutation](transmutation.md)) Gravitic Repulsion Each foe in a 50-foot emanation is pushed 100 feet away unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.
- **Agyra, the Forever Storm** Speed 80 feet, fly 200 feet; **Arrive** ([electricity](electricity.md), [evocation](evocation.md)) _Breath of a Thousand Storms_ Agyra shoots two 1,200-foot lines of electricity, one from each of her heads. The lines can't overlap. Each creature along one of the lines takes `6d12` electricity damage with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, the creature is also [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 round (or for 1 minute on a critical failure); **Depart** ([evocation](evocation.md), [sonic](sonic.md)) _Thunderous Blast_ Each creature within a 100-foot emanation takes `6d10` sonic damage with a basic Reflex save, and is also knocked [prone](conditions.md#Prone) on a failed save.
- **Bezravnis, the Inferno Below** Speed 100 feet, burrow 100 feet; **Arrive** ([earth](earth.md), [evocation](evocation.md)) _Burrow from the Earth's Heart_ Bezravnis explodes from the ground where it was summoned, causing all creatures in a 50-foot emanation to take `8d12` bludgeoning damage with a basic Reflex save. This potentially collapses structures with the collapse effect of the [earthquake](compendium/spells/earthquake.md) spell, except there is no chance of falling into a fissure; **Depart** _Web Hurricane_ Bezravnis departs with a hurricane of webbing. All creatures within a 50-foot emanation must succeed at a Reflex save or take a â€“20-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until it [Escapes](escape.md) (or is [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized) until it escapes on a critical failure). The [Escape](escape.md) DC is your spell DC.
- **Mogaru, the Final King** Speed 100 feet, swim 100 feet; **Arrive** ([auditory](auditory.md), [enchantment](enchantment.md), [mental](mental.md)) _Trance of the King's Melody_ Mogaru manifests with a burst of the song that summoned him, requiring all foes within 60 feet who can hear him to attempt a Will save, leaving them [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned) on a failure; **Depart** ([evocation](evocation.md), [fire](fire.md)) _Volcanic Breath_ Mogaru unleashes his scorching breath in a 120-foot cone. Each creature in the area takes `10d6` fire damage with a basic Reflex save. On a failure, it also takes `4d6` [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
- **Vorgozen, the Shapeless Feeder** Speed 50 feet, climb 50 feet, swim 100 feet; **Arrive** ([necromancy](necromancy.md)) _Pollute Magic_ Vorgozen's foul presence pollutes magic around her. Each of your enemies within a 60-foot emanation that are under the effects of a spell must attempt a Fortitude save. On a failure, the creature is [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened). Any of your enemies that [Casts a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) within 60 feet of Vorgozen must attempt a Fortitude save with the same effects unless it's already [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened); **Depart** ([acid](acid.md), [evocation](evocation.md)) _Beam of Purest Vitriol_ Each creature in a 1,200-foot line takes `10d6` acid damage and `10d6` bludgeoning damage with a basic Fortitude save.

Creatures that fail and reach the center take `10d6` bludgeoning damage; **Depart** ([electricity](electricity.md), [evocation](evocation.md)) _Storm Discharge_ Each foe in a 240-foot line takes `12d8` electricity damage with a basic Reflex save
