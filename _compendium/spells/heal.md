# Heal *Spell 1*   
[healing](healing.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [positive](positive.md)  

- **Traditions**: [divine](divine.md), [primal](primal.md)
- **Cast** [>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") to [>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") 
- **Range**varies
- **Targets**1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature

You channel positive energy to heal the living or damage the undead. If the target is a willing living creature, you restore `1d8` Hit Points. If the target is undead, you deal that amount of positive damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. The number of actions you spend when [Casting this Spell](cast-a-spell.md) determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

**[>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action") (somatic)** The spell has a range of touch.

**[>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") (verbal, somatic)** The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.

**[>>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Three-Action") (material, somatic, verbal)** You disperse positive energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

**Heightened (+ 1)** The amount of healing or damage increases by `1d8`, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
