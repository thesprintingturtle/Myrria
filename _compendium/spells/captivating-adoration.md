# Captivating Adoration *Focus 4*   
[cleric](rules/traits/cleric.md)  [emotion](emotion.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [mental](mental.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  [visual](visual.md)  

- **Domains**: [[passion](../setting/domains.md#Passion)]
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Area**15-foot emanation
- **Saving Throw** Will
- **Duration**1 minute

You become intensely entrancing, and creatures are distracted by you as long as they remain within the area. You can exclude any creatures you choose from the effects.

When a creature enters the area for the first time, it must attempt a Will saving throw. If a creature leaves and reenters, it uses the results of its original save.

> - **Success** The creature is [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) with you for its next action, then is temporarily immune for 1 hour.
> - **Failure** The creature is [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) with you.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [fascinated](conditions.md#Fascinated) with you, and its attitude toward you improves by one step.

**Heightened (+ 1)** Increase the size of the emanation by 15 feet.
