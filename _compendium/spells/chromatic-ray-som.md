# Chromatic Ray *Spell 4*   
[attack](attack.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [light](rules/traits/light.md)  

- **Traditions**: [arcane](arcane.md), [occult](occult.md)
- **Cast** [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") 
- **Range**30 foot
- **Targets**1 creature

You send out a ray of colored light streaming toward your enemy, with a [magical](magical.md) effect depending on the ray's color.

Make a spell attack roll. If you hit, roll `1d4` to see which beam you cast. If the ray deals damage, that damage is doubled on a critical hit. Any additional traits that apply to a ray are listed in parentheses just after the name of the color.

- **1. Red** ([fire](fire.md)) The ray deals 30 fire damage to the target.
- **2. Orange** ([acid](acid.md)) The ray deals 40 acid damage to the target.
- **3. Yellow** ([electricity](electricity.md)) The ray deals 50 electricity damage to the target.
- **4. Green** ([poison](rules/traits/poison.md)) The ray deals 25 poison damage to the target, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) for 1 minute ([enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) on a critical failure).

**Heightened (6th)** The damage for red, orange, yellow, and green each increase by 10. Roll `1d8` to determine the ray's color, using the results for 1–4 above and the results for 5–8 below.

- **5. Blue** The ray has the effect of the [flesh to stone](flesh-to-stone.md) spell. On a critical hit, the target is [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) as long as it's [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) by the flesh to stone effect.
- **6. Indigo** ([emotion](emotion.md), [incapacitation](incapacitation.md), [mental](mental.md)) The ray has the effect of the [confusion](compendium/spells/confusion.md) spell. On a critical hit, it has the effect of [warp mind](warp-mind.md) instead.
- **7. Violet** The target is [slowed](conditions.md#Slowed) for 1 minute. It must also succeed at a Will save or be teleported 120 feet directly away from you (if there isn't room for it to appear there, it appears in the nearest open space); this is a [teleportation](teleportation.md) effect.
- **8. Intense Color** The target is [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) until the end of your next turn, or [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) if your attack roll was a critical hit. Roll again and add the effects of another color (rerolling results of 8).
