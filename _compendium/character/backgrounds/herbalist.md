# Herbalist
*Source: Core Rulebook p. 62*  

As a formally trained apothecary or a rural practitioner of folk medicine, you learned the healing properties of various herbs.

You're adept at collecting the right natural cures in all sorts of environments and preparing them properly.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) skill and the [Herbalism Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Natural Medicine](../../feats/natural-medicine.md) skill feat.
