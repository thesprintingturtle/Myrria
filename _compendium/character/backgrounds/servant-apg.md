# Servant
*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 49*  

You held a role of servitude, waiting on nobles and engendering their trust as one of the confidantes of the household. You might have walked away on good terms, or perhaps you know dangerous secrets about your former masters. Regardless, you're adventuring for a change and finding that in this new role, the skills you've learned now serve you.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../skills.md#Society) skill and the [Labor Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Read Lips](../../feats/read-lips.md) skill feat.
