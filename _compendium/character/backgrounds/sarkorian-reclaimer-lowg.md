# Sarkorian Reclaimer
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 34*  

Whether you trace your heritage to lost Sarkoris or are a crusader trying to atone for past fanatics' wrongs, you seek to liberate the Sarkorian homeland from the demons who have defiled it.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free boost.

You're trained in the [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) skill and the [Abyssal Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Battle Medicine](../../feats/battle-medicine.md) skill feat.
