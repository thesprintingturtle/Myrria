# Feral Child
*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 50*  

You spent your youth in the wilderness, living close to or perhaps raised by animals. You have a close, mystical connection with these animals and gained certain abilities from them, though this limited your well-roundedness in mental pursuits.

Choose one ability boost. It must be Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

You are trained in [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) and [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival). You gain [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md) (or [darkvision](rules/abilities/darkvision.md) if you already had [low-light vision](low-light-vision.md)), imprecise [scent](scent.md) with a range of 30 feet, and the [Forager](../../feats/forager.md) skill feat.
