# Atteran Rancher
*Source: Lost Omens: World Guide p. 106*  

You grew up breeding and training the famous horses of the Atteran Ranches in northern Nidal. You may even be sympathetic to the Desnan dissidents who hide there from the Umbral Court.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) skill and the [Animal Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Train Animal](../../feats/train-animal.md) skill feat.
