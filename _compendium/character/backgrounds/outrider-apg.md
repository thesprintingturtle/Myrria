# Outrider
*Source: Advanced Player's Guide p. 48*  

In your youth, you galloped on horseback over vast prairies, serving as a vanguard for your settlement, an army, or another group. Seeing so many different lands built a thirst in you to adventure and explore the world instead of just racing past it.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) skill and the [Plains Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill.

You gain the [Express Rider](../../feats/express-rider-apg.md) skill feat.
