# Archaeologist
*Source: Lost Omens: Pathfinder Society Guide p. 8*  

You've excavated enough sites to know that ancient civilizations aren't lost; they're merely buried and waiting for the right scholar to unearth them and tell their story. You might have worked as a laborer or local guide before learning formal archaeological techniques.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../skills.md#Society) skill and the [Architecture Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Additional Lore](../../feats/additional-lore.md) skill feat related to an ancient culture or the history of a culture you've studied (such as [Azlanti Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) or [Osirian History Lore](../../skills.md#Lore)).
