# Codebreaker
*Source: Guns & Gears p. 44*  

Whether you're employed by a military organization to decipher coded messages sent by enemy factions or work independently to crack an enigma created by a past civilization, you have a head for patterns and linguistics.

You might even use new clockwork devices to aid you in your efforts.

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.

You're trained in the [Society](../../skills.md#Society) skill and the [Cryptography Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skill. You gain the [Glean Contents](../../feats/glean-contents-apg.md) skill feat.
