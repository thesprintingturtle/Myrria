# Tongues Of Flame *Hazard 5*  
[complex](complex.md)  [mechanical](mechanical.md)  [trap](trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Complex
- **Stealth** DC 23 [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception).  

Nozzles [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) in the ceiling of the four corridors leading to the intersection spray jets of flame along their lengths when the trap is triggered.

- **Disable** DC 22 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) to disable a single nozzle, DC 21 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) twice to unlock a door, or DC 25 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) to deactivate the trap from the control panel. A hero who isn't trained in [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) automatically fails these checks.
