# Blast Tumbler *Hazard 10*  
[magical](magical.md)  [mechanical](mechanical.md)  [trap](trap.md)  

- **Complexity** Simple
- **Stealth** DC 32 master  

A hard-to-reach rune is placed on the lock's tumbler. It emits a blast of force when the door is jostled.

- **Disable** DC 32 [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) (master) to disarm the rune, or dispel magic (5th level; counteract DC 28) to counteract the rune's magic.

[evocation](../../../rules/traits/evocation.md)  [force](../../../rules/traits/force.md)  [occult](../../../rules/traits/occult.md)  

- **Trigger**: A non-undead creature opens the door or critically fails an attempt to disarm or dispel the rune

**Effect** A 30-foot cone of force issues forth from the lock. Creatures within the cone must succeed a DC 29 basic Fortitude saving throw or take `8d12` force damage. Those who fail the save are pushed 10 feet, and those who critically fail are pushed 20 feet and are [stunned](../../../rules/conditions.md#Stunned).

**Reset** The rune resets 1 minute after it triggers.
