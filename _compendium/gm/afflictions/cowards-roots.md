# Coward's Roots
*Curse 4*  
[curse](curse.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [fear](rules/traits/fear.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

You find all courage stolen from your heart. When faced with something frightening, you flee in terror or stand frozen in place.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 20 Will

**Effect** At the start of your turn, if you are [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened), you become your choice of [immobilized](../../../rules/conditions.md#Immobilized) or [fleeing](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fleeing) until the end of that turn.
