# Curse of Nightmares
*Curse 2*  
[curse](curse.md)  [illusion](illusion.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [mental](mental.md)  

This curse plagues you with terrible nightmares whenever you sleep, preventing you from resting properly.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 16 Will

**Effect** You must rest for 12 hours instead of 8 to avoid becoming [fatigued](../../../rules/conditions.md#Fatigued) and can't gain any benefits from resting or long-term rest. You can still make your daily preparations.
```
