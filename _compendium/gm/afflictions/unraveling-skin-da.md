# Unraveling Skin
*Curse 5*  
[curse](curse.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [rare](rare.md)  

Often used to protect ancient tomes, this curse causes your skin to shed like weathered paper, cracking and bleeding at the slightest touch.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 20 Fortitude

**Effect** Seeping wounds cover your body as this curse makes your skin brittle. Any time you would gain the [wounded](../../../rules/conditions.md#Wounded) condition, increase the value by 1. Any time you take bleed damage, increase the amount of damage by 1.
```

## Tempting Curse

Your skin falls from your body and exposes your raw flesh beneath, but the curse holds your flesh together as its magic increases. You gain resistance to persistent bleed damage equal to half your level and are [doomed](conditions.md#Doomed).
