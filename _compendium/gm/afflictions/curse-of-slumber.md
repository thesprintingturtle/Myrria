# Curse of Slumber
*Curse 11*  
[curse](curse.md)  [incapacitation](incapacitation.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [necromancy](necromancy.md)  [sleep](rules/traits/sleep.md)  

This legendary curse sends you into a sleep indistinguishable from death.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 28 Fortitude

**Effect** You fall asleep for 1 round (or permanently on a critical failure) and seem to be dead; a creature must succeed at a DC 30 [Medicine](../../../compendium/skills.md#Medicine) check to realize you are alive. Noise doesn't awaken you, but taking damage gives you a new saving throw against the curse.
```
