# Curse of the Ravenous
*Curse 5*  
[curse](curse.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

This hideous curse kills through constant hunger. You become gaunt and repeatedly gnash your teeth.

```ad-inline-affliction
title: Saving Throw: DC 20 Fortitude

**Effect** No matter how much you eat, you aren't satiated. After 1 day, you begin starving ("_Core Rulebook" 500|CRB|10|Starvation and Thirst_). Each week, you receive a new saving throw against the curse.
