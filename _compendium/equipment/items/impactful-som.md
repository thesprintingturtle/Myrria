- **Usage** etched onto a weapon
- **Category** Rune

This rune thrums with pure magical energy. Weapons with the rune deal an additional `1d6` force damage on a successful [Strike](strike.md). On a critical hit, you can choose to force the target to succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be pushed 5 feet away from you.
