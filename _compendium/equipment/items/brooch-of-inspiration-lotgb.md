This finely cut garnet brooch fills your mind with vigor and occasional bursts of mental clarity. While wearing the brooch, you gain a +1 item bonus to checks to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) with [Lore](../../skills.md#Lore) skills.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You think hard on a topic and receive a sudden inspiration. You attempt to [Recall Knowledge](../../../rules/actions/recall-knowledge.md) using [Lore](../../../compendium/skills.md#Lore).

On this check, you roll twice and take the higher result.
