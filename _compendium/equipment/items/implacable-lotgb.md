# Implacable *Item 11*

- **Price** 1200 gp

This substantial rune makes you difficult to hold back.

Whenever you are affected by an effect that lasts until you [Escape](escape.md) (for instance, from the [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) action or a tanglefoot bag), you become [quickened](conditions.md#Quickened). You can use the extra action each round only to [Step](step.md) or [Escape](escape.md).
