A thick, sulfurous, irritating gas fills this golden-yellow flask.

A sulfur bomb deals the listed damage. On a hit, the target takes a â€“1 status penalty to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks and attack rolls until the end of its next turn, or becomes [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical hit. Creatures hit with this bomb are temporarily immune to the effects of the bomb for 1 minute.
