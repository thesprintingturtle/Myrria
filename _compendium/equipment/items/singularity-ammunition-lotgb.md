Singularity ammunition seems to pull in the light around it, swirling along the surface in a misty pattern. An activated singularity arrow creates a strong gravitational force, centered on the creature hit.

All creatures in a 10-foot emanation from the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be pulled 5 feet closer to the target. The singularity then explodes, dealing `7d12` bludgeoning damage to the original target and all creatures in a 5-foot emanation (DC 28 basic Reflex save).
