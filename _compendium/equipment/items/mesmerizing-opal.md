# Mesmerizing Opal *Item 2*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [enchantment](enchantment.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [talisman](talisman.md)  

- **Price** 7 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You attempt a [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) check to [Feint](feint.md), but you haven't rolled yet.
- **Category** Talisman

This silver-bound opal pendant is afire with iridescence.

When you activate it, if the outcome of your triggering [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) check is a critical failure, you get a failure instead (or if the outcome is a success, you get a critical success instead).
