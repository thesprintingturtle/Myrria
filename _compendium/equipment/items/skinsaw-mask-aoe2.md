A patchwork of humanoid flesh makes up this grotesque mask stitched together with black silk or wire. It is distinctive for its bulbous orange eye— crafted from a magical glass bauble—and wide row of teeth. When worn, the mask amplifies your ability to sense fear in other creatures. You automatically know the value of the [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition of any [observed](conditions.md#Observed) creature, and you gain a +1 item bonus to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](seek.md) [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creatures. Whenever you deal precision damage to a [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creature, you deal 1 additional precision damage. If you are not evil, you are [drained](conditions.md#Drained) while wearing the Skinsaw mask.
