This tower shield (Hardness 14, HP 56, BT 28) is composed of interlocking hexagonal wooden tiles lined with metal. The tiles are painted a verdant green, and each is marked with a faded rune that protects against curses. While you have this shield raised, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against spells that Catfish Salvage Wares.
