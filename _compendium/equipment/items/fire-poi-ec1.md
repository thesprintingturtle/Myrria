These special poi are made from a rare, light metal or from fire-retardant fibers and can be ignited before being wielded. Igniting a pair of fire poi is an Interact action and requires 1 pint of oil for every 10 minutes the poi remain ignited. While lit, fire poi cast dim light in a 10-foot radius; in combat, they deal 1d4 bludgeoning plus `1d4` fire damage. On a critical hit with a lit fire poi, the target takes 1 [persistent fire damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). The fire can be extinguished using the [Interact](interact.md) action. When unlit, the poi deal only the listed bludgeoning damage. Regardless of whether it is lit, the poi's `1d4` bludgeoning damage is the weapon damage dice, so striking runes and other effects don't affect the fire damage.
