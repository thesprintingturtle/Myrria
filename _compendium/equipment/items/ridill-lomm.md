This 12-foot sword was made by a cyclops in the ancient past. It might be the greatest dragon-killing weapon ever made, and Fafnheir justly fears it, which is why he keeps it hidden in his hoard. Runes of dragon slaying are written down its blade. Ridill is a greatsword. While wielding Ridill, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saves against [fear](rules/traits/fear.md). This increases to +4 if the effect is from a dragon. If you have an ability that depends on Large weapons (such as barbarian giant instinct), it works with Ridill.

Ridill is always considered to have the appropriate material or damage type necessary to deactivate a dragon's [regeneration](regeneration.md) or cause the dragon's weakness to apply. For example, Ridill is considered to be cold iron when attacking a linnorm, while it would be treated as having dealt cold damage when attacking a red dragon. If the dragon has more than one weakness, only the highest value applies.
