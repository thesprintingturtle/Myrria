# Bomb Snare *Item 8*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [mechanical](mechanical.md)  [snare](snare.md)  [trap](trap.md)  

- **Price** 75 gp
- **Category** Snare

You create a snare that catalyzes three 3rd-level moderate alchemical bombs of the same type to explode when a creature enters the snare's square. The target and all creatures in adjacent squares must attempt a DC 26 Reflex save, as the snare deals damage equal to three times the direct hit damage from one of the component bombs (for example, `6d6` electricity damage from bottled lightning) with no splash damage or other effects.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature takes half damage and no other effects.
> - **Failure** The creature takes full damage. It also takes all other effects of a direct hit from one of the component bombs (such as [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) from bottled lightning or [persistent damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) from an acid flask).
> - **Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, plus all other effects of a direct hit (as failure).
