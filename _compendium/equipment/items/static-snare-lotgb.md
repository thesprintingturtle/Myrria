# Static Snare *Item 2*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [electricity](electricity.md)  [mechanical](mechanical.md)  [snare](snare.md)  [trap](trap.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 6 gp
- **Category** Snare

You hide insulating crystals or other material that releases a strong static charge when the first creature enters the snare's square. That creature must attempt a DC 18 Reflex saving throw.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The target is unaffected.
> - **Failure** The target takes 1 [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) and takes a –1 circumstance penalty to saving throws against [electricity](electricity.md) effects for as long as the [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) lasts.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, and the target attracts nearby dirt and dust. If the target is or becomes [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible), it's merely [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to creatures that have sight as a precise sense. This effect lasts as long as the [persistent electricity damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) does. "I've bit off more than I can chew? Oh no, the bite's not just for me—meals are meant to be shared!" The Mask and Moon is one of the most notable restaurants in Absalom; its proprietor is equally famous. The main dining area is beneath a soaring, open-sided oak timber frame roofed with glazed clay tiles in white, red, blue, and gold. Two spiraling posts evoking the Mordant Spire flank the wide entrance. At the apex of the entryway hangs a full moon shield inlaid with a simplified Spire mask emblem.
