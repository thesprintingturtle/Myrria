# Armor Potency *Item 5+*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto armor
- **Category** Rune

Magic wards deflect attacks. Increase the armor's item bonus to AC by 1. The armor can be etched with one property rune.

You can upgrade the armor potency rune already etched on a suit of armor to a stronger version, increasing the values of the existing rune to those of the new rune. You must have the formula of the stronger rune to do so, and the Price of the upgrade is the difference between the two runes' Prices.
