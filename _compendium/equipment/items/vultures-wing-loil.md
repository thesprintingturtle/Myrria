This fan of vulture feathers scatters on an unnatural gust of wind. If this catalyst is used to cast a [ray of enfeeblement](../../spells/ray-of-enfeeblement.md) spell that has been heightened to at least 5th level, instead of targeting a single creature, you cast the spell in a 30-foot-area cone. You don't make a spell attack roll, instead affecting all creatures within the area with the effect the spell would normally have on a hit. This means creatures within the area must attempt a Fortitude save to determine whether they're [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled).
