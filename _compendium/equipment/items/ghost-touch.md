# Ghost Touch *Item 4*  
[magical](magical.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Price** 75 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a melee weapon
- **Category** Rune

The weapon can harm creatures without physical form. A ghost touch weapon is particularly effective against incorporeal creatures, which almost always have a specific weakness to ghost touch weapons. Incorporeal creatures can touch, hold, and wield ghost touch weapons (unlike most physical objects).
