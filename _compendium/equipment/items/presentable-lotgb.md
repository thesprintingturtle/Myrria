[enchantment](enchantment.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** applied to any visible article of clothing
- **Category** Rune

A garment with this rune is always clean, as though it had just been affected by [prestidigitation](../../spells/prestidigitation.md). You gain a +1 item bonus to [Make an Impression](make-an-impression.md) on those who would be impressed by a particular presentable outfit while wearing this garment.
