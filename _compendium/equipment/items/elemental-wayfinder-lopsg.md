Pathfinder Society researchers recently created elemental wayfinders with the assistance of the Society's elemental allies. In addition to the effects of a [wayfinder](wayfinder.md), these wayfinders each grant the ability to cast a particular elemental spell once per day, and can assist Pathfinders in exploring areas associated with their element. Each has the trait associated with its element.

The wayfinder casts its associated spell.
