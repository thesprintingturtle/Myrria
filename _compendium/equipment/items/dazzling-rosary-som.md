When energy courses through these lustrous beads, they glow brightly in the sacred colors of the spellcaster's faith. A spiritual weapon empowered with this catalyst flashes with bright light when it critically [Strikes](strike.md) a target, causing the target to be [dazzled](conditions.md#Dazzled) until the beginning of your next turn.
