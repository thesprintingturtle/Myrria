Scholarly journals are uncommon. Each scholarly journal is a folio on a very specific topic, such as vampires or the history of a single town or neighborhood of a city. If you spend 1 minute referencing an academic journal before attempting a skill check to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md) about the subject, you gain a +1 item bonus to the check. The GM determines what scholarly journals are available in any location.
