[invested](invested.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [transmutation](transmutation.md)  

- **Usage** worn eyepiece
- **Category** Worn

The opaque crystal lenses of these sleek goggles do not obscure vision, but rather enhance it. While wearing the goggles, you gain a +1 item bonus to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks involving sight.

Rotating the lenses 90 degrees, you gain [darkvision](../../../rules/abilities/darkvision.md) for 1 hour.
