This thin, black liquid imparts a bone-deep chill while rapidly repairing an undead creature's physical or spiritual form. When you dash oil of unlife onto an undead creature, or a living creature with negative healing, the oil absorbs quickly into its body, and the creature regains the listed number of Hit Points.

You can pour oil of unlife on an incorporeal undead; in this case, the creature absorbs the oil into itself.
