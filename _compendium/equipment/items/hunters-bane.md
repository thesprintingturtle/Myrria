# Hunter's Bane *Item 2*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [divination](divination.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [talisman](talisman.md)  

- **Price** 6 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** An [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) enemy hits you with an attack; **Requirements** You are trained in [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival).
- **Category** Talisman

This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven leaves. When you activate the hunter's bane, you sense the exact location of the attacker, making it [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) from you instead of [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected). If the attacker is behind lead, the hunter's bane fails and is wasted.
