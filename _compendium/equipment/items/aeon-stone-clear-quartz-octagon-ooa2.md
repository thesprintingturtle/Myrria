This clear quartz stone appears to have been smashed and then repaired by pouring molten copper into the cracks and fitting the shards back together using the copper as a sort of mortar. When a non-magical item in your possession with a value of 90 gp or less and a Bulk of 1 Bulk or less would become [broken](conditions.md#Broken), this aeon stone automatically activates, preventing the item from breaking by restoring the item's current Hit Points to the item's maximum Hit Points. The stone then turns permanently into a dull gray aeon stone. The stone's resonant power allows you to cast 1st-level [mending](../../spells/mending.md) as a divine innate spell once per day.
