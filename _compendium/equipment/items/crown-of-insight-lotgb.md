A series of evenly spaced, unblinking tattooed eyes line your skin. When you enter an area that contains creatures within 60 feet that are [unnoticed](conditions.md#Unnoticed) to you, the GM rolls a secret [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check for you against the creatures' [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) DCs. On a success, the creature becomes [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) by you, rather than [unnoticed](conditions.md#Unnoticed), and on a critical success, the creature becomes [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to you. All creatures in the area are then temporarily immune to your crown of insight for 24 hours. The crown of insight doesn't help you find [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) items or traps, nor can it help you discern a creature hiding in plain sight, such as a gargoyle pretending to be an inanimate statue. Additionally, since the effect occurs when you move to enter an area that contains creatures, it doesn't detect an [unnoticed](conditions.md#Unnoticed) creature Sneaking up on you.
