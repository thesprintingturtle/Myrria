# Life Salt *Item 5*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [divine](divine.md)  [positive](positive.md)  

- **Price** 25 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Activate** [Strike](strike.md)
- **Category** Consumable

This crystal vial contains salts blessed by channeling life-giving energies into waters purified by holy fire.

You can activate this vial by throwing it as a [Strike](strike.md). It's a simple thrown ranged weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Unlike an alchemical bomb, it doesn't add the [manipulate](manipulate.md) trait to the attack made with it. On a hit against an undead, life salt deals 1 [persistent positive damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage), and the undead must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be unable to attack you as long as it continues taking the [persistent positive damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).

If you use a [hostile](conditions.md#Hostile) action against any undead, this second effect ends, and the undead can attack you normally.
