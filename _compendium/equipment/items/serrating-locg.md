# Serrating *Item 10*  
[evocation](evocation.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 1000 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a slashing melee weapon

A serrating weapon's bladed edge separates into jagged, swirling shards that spin along the blade. When dealing slashing damage, the weapon deals an additional `1d4` damage.

You brandish the weapon and focus its power, causing the serrated shards to buzz as they spin at a dizzying speed. On your next hit with the weapon this turn that deals slashing damage, the serrating rune adds an additional `1d12` damage instead of the additional `1d4` damage, and then the shards return to their usual speed.
