# Queasy Lantern *Item 7+*

This bull's-eye lantern is wrapped in decrepit leather skin. It constantly emits light in a 60-foot cone (and dim light in the next 60 feet). You can close or open internal shutters with an [Interact](interact.md) action to block or reveal the light.

You slide in a magical lens that causes the lantern to emit a pale green light and then aim the lantern. All creatures in the lantern's 60-foot cone of bright light (but not those in the dim light), must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. On a failure, a creature becomes [sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) ([sickened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Sickened) on a critical failure). The light then reverts to normal as the lens slides out of place.
