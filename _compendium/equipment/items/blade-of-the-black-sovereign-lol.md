This +2 greater striking shock greatsword is forged from standard-grade adamantine, with inlays of [broken](conditions.md#Broken) circuitry and a robot's ocular lens on the cross guard. A soft thrum comes from the blade, which you feel as a subtle pulse through the grip when wielding it.

It sparks when unsheathed, emitting dim light within 5 feet. On a hit against a foe made of metal, wearing metal armor, or using a metal shield, if the foe takes electricity damage from the blade, the makes the foe [flat-footed](conditions.md#Flat-footed) for 1 round; if the [Strike](strike.md) was a critical hit, it also makes them [clumsy](conditions.md#Clumsy) for 1 round.
