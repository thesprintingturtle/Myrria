This weapon is a fully functional, lavish ink pen with a clip that can be attached to a pocket or bandoleer and easily retrieved as a free action. Using an action to Interact with the pen allows its wielder to disengage a stiletto blade that slides free of the upper body or reattach the previously removed blade.
