The vials containing this translucent, unsubstantial oil are always cold to the touch. Applying ghost oil to a melee weapon you're wielding or carrying causes it to become semitransparent and gain the effects of a ghost touch rune, but it also makes the weapon unable to harm corporeal creatures. The oil has no effect when applied to another creature's weapon. The effect of the oil lasts for 1 minute.
