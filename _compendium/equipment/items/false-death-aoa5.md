Typically used to fake one's death, this poison swiftly causes the imbiber to lose consciousness and suppresses vital signs. A creature examining the [unconscious](conditions.md#Unconscious) target must succeed at a [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) check against the imbiber's [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) DC + 4 to determine that the target is alive, and a critical success allows the examiner to determine that a toxin is causing the effect. The false death toxin has an extremely bitter taste ([Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) DC 10 to detect), making it difficult to trick a creature into consuming the poison against its wishes.
