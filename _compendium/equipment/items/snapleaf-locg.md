# Snapleaf *Item 3*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [illusion](illusion.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [talisman](talisman.md)  

- **Price** 9 gp

This small, crystalline carving takes the shape of a tree leaf and attaches to armor or clothing with a simple strap. When you activate the snapleaf, you gain the benefits of feather fall and a 2nd-level [invisibility](../../spells/invisibility.md) spell for 1 minute or until you stop falling, whichever comes first.
