A thin sheen of slick oil covers this gaudy button. When you activate the oily button, your attempts to [Disarm](rules/actions/disarm.md) your opponent of an item before the start of the opponent's next turn gain a +4 circumstance bonus instead of +2, and the â€“2 circumstance penalty to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on the item lasts until the end of its next turn or until it uses an [Interact](interact.md) action to adjust its grip.
