A potion of shared memories can transfer recollections from one creature to another. To place a memory in the potion, you must hold the vial and focus on a particular memory for 1 minute. This memory must be of a single event, location, person, or otherwise encompass a span of about 1 minute.

The clear fluid takes on a shimmering hue reminiscent of the stored memory and gains a slightly sweet taste.

Upon consuming the potion, the drinker vividly recalls the memory, and thereafter can remember it as easily as a memory they actually experienced. An unwilling drinker can refuse to absorb the memory.
