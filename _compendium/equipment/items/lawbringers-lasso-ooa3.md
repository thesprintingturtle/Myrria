This enchanted lasso is a net (Advanced Player's Guide 249) that can be used to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) creatures up to 30 feet away, requires a DC 18 [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) check to [Force Open](force-open.md), and has an [Escape](escape.md) DC of 18. It's permanently attached to a 30-foot rope.

While using the lawbringer's lasso to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md), you receive a +1 item bonus to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) checks against creatures with the [chaotic](chaotic.md) trait. If you roll a critical failure on your attempt to [Grapple](rules/actions/grapple.md) a chaotic creature with the lawbringer's lasso, you get a failure instead.
