# Thieves' Tools *Item 0*  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Bulk** L
- **Hands** 1 or 2*
- **Category** Adventuring Gear

You need thieves' tools to [Pick Locks](pick-a-lock.md) or [Disable Devices](disable-a-device.md) (of some types) using the [Thievery](../../skills.md#Thievery) skill. If your thieves' tools are broken, you can repair them by replacing the lock picks with replacement picks appropriate to your tools; this doesn't require using the [Repair](repair.md) action. If you wear your thieves' tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.

> [!pf2-note]
> You can use the set of tools with one hand if you are wearing it.
