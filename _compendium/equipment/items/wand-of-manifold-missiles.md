```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate

You cast [magic missile](../../../compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) of the indicated level. After you cast the spell, an additional missile or missiles are released from the wand at the start of each of your turns, as though you cast the 1-action version of [magic missile](../../../compendium/spells/magic-missile.md). Choose targets each time. This lasts for 1 minute, until you're no longer wielding the wand, or until you try to activate the wand again.
```
