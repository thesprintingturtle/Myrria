A [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) copper plate conceals a bag of electric eels. When a creature steps on the plate, the eels become agitated, and the creature takes `4d8` electricity damage (DC 21 basic Reflex save). On a critical failure, the current causes the creature to become [stunned](conditions.md#Stunned). The eels are unharmed after use, but the mechanism is [broken](conditions.md#Broken) as usual for snares.

An intricate maze of well-ordered exhibits and shelves, the Historia Reliquary is almost more of a museum than a store. The front is covered with a heavy black curtain that is pinned in place with wooden stakes to prevent passersby from sneaking a look at what is inside.

Erikanesh charges a modest admission fee of one silver piece, though they happily waive it for anyone with items to add to the Reliquary's inventory.
