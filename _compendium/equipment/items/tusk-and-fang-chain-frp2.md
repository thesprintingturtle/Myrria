This length of silver chain has a tiger's fang on one end and the tip of a dire boar's tusk on the other. When you activate the chain, an ephemeral chain encircles the target creature's head and a cacophony of animal sounds clouds its mind. It must attempt a DC 35 Will save.

> - **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
> - **Success** The creature is [confused](conditions.md#Confused) on its next action.
> - **Failure** The creature is [confused](conditions.md#Confused) for 1 round.
> - **Critical Failure** The creature is [confused](conditions.md#Confused) for 1 minute and the creature doesn't receive a flat check to end its confusion if it takes damage. At the end of each of its turns, it attempts a new Will save, ending the effect on a success.
