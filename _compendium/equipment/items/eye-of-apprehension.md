# Eye of Apprehension *Item 12*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [divination](divination.md)  [fortune](fortune.md)  [talisman](talisman.md)  

- **Price** 400 gp
- **Usage** affixed to armor
- **Activate** envision; **Trigger** You are about to roll [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) for initiative but haven't rolled yet; **Requirements** You are a master in [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception).
- **Category** Talisman

This round piece of cymophane's silky inclusion makes it look like a cat's eye. While affixed, it makes you jittery. When you activate it, roll [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) twice and use the higher result.
