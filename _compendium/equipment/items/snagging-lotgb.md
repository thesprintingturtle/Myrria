This animated item attempts to catch you when you fall. You can attempt to [Grab an Edge](grab-an-edge.md) (Core Rulebook 472), even if your hands are tied behind your back or otherwise [restrained](conditions.md#Restrained), so long as there's a solid edge within 10 feet. If you roll a success, you can Grab the Edge even if you don't have a hand free.
