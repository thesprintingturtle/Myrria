# Blade Launcher *Item 1*  
[uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 18 gp
- **Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

A blade launcher has a bow-like assembly mounted on a handled frame. The frame can be configured to fire either a dagger, dart, shuriken, or starknife. Configuring a blade launcher requires three [Interact](interact.md) actions. Once properly configured, loading an appropriate thrown weapon into a blade launcher requires a single [Interact](interact.md) action. A blade launcher can't fire weapons for which it's not currently configured. A weapon fired with a blade launcher loses the agile, monk, [thrown](thrown.md), and [versatile](versatile.md) traits, if it has them, and has a range increment of 40 feet. Due to losing the thrown weapon trait, returning and most other effects that allow a weapon to return don't function; even if a launched weapon did return, you'd still need to load it into the blade launcher with an [Interact](interact.md) action to fire the blade launcher again.
