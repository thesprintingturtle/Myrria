title: Activate [R](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Reaction")

- **Trigger**: A ranged weapon attack hits you but doesn't critically hit
- **Requirements**: You are aware of the attack and not [flat-footed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Flat-footed)

**Effect** The bracers send the missile off-course. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If this would cause the attack to be a failure, the attack misses you.
