Each cassock of devotion depicts scenes related to the domains of a certain deity. It serves as a religious symbol of that deity, and it doesn't need to be wielded to provide that benefit. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) checks and a +1 item bonus to the divine skill of the deity to whom the cassock is dedicated (as listed on pages 437â€“440).

You gain 1 Focus Point, which you can spend only to cast a cleric domain spell for a domain belonging to the deity the cassock is dedicated to. If you don't spend this Focus Point by the end of this turn, it is lost.
