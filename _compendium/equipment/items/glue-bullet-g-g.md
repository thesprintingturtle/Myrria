These cartridges are filled with sticky clear glue. When a glue bullet hits, a syrupy webbing coats the target and sticks to the ground or a nearby surface, hindering their movement. The target takes a â€“10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for `2d4` rounds, or until it Escapes against a DC of 18. On a critical hit, the target is also [immobilized](conditions.md#Immobilized) until it Escapes.
