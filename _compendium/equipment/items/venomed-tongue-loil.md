This tattoo of braided tongues provides a +1 item bonus to [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) checks.

title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

[Abraxas](../../../compendium/setting/deities/abraxas-logm.md) fills your tongue with venom, causing your deceptions to poison your foes. You use [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) to [Create a Diversion](../../../rules/actions/create-a-diversion.md), [Feint](../../../rules/actions/feint.md), or [Lie](../../../rules/actions/lie.md). Choose one target against whom your [Deception](../../../compendium/skills.md#Deception) check succeeded; that target takes `2d6` [persistent poison damage](../../../rules/conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
```
