# Daredevil Boots *Item 10+*  
[abjuration](abjuration.md)  [invested](invested.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Usage** worn shoes; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

These brightly colored, soft-soled boots motivate you to perform risky stunts and grant you the agility to succeed. The boots grant you a +2 item bonus to [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to [Tumble Through](tumble-through.md) an enemy's space.

The boots can grip solid surfaces and help you avoid a fall, allowing you to use the [Grab an Edge](grab-an-edge.md) reaction even if your hands aren't free. You treat falls as 10 feet shorter or, if you have the Cat Fall feat, treat your proficiency rank in [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) as one degree better to determine the benefits of that feat. If you have Cat Fall and are already legendary in [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics), you can choose the speed of your fall, from 60 feet per round up to normal falling speed.
