This porous steel coil wraps around a shard of onyx, supplementing the closely guarded science of galvaspheres with the magic of necromancy. When embedded in a body comprised of flesh, the blood and other fluids catalyze electrical pulses within the coil, activating the necromantic energies. In living creatures, this causes a dangerous surge that can damage the heart. In corpses, however, this can create a limited window of reanimation, with access to the corpse's final memories. Galvanic mortal coils are even rarer than other galvaspheres, and thought by most to be merely hypothetical.
