These ominous swords are decorated with crimson lacquer and serve as perfect conduits for the Crimson Oath's power. The first was granted to Clarethe Iomedar by a mysterious patron who many Reclaimers believe to be an emissary of Ragathiel.

A crimson brand is a +1 striking wounding bastard sword. When the wielder uses the crimson brand to cast [invoke the Crimson Oath](../../spells/invoke-the-crimson-oath-locg.md) (page 90), they can generate a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone instead of the normal 20-foot cone. Whenever the wielder would inflict [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) on an undead creature with the crimson brand, they can instead wreathe the creature in ruby energy, inflicting the same amount of [persistent positive damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) instead of [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage).
