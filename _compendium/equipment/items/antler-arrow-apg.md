Creation of these arrows was inspired by an encounter with a horned archon scout who sought to peacefully restrain their foes. When an activated antler arrow hits a target, bone antlers extend to pin it down. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or become stuck to the surface, taking the critical specialization effects of a bow (Core Rulebook 284)

If the hit with the antler arrow is a critical hit and you have access to the bow critical specialization effect, the DC of the [Athletics](../../skills.md#Athletics) check increases to 15.
