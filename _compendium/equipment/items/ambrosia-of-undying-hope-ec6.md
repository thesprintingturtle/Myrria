This elixir is usually stored in a small metal flask or miniature stein. The dark liquid sparkles as if it were full of stars and is considered sacred to [Cayden Cailean](../../setting/deities/cayden-cailean.md) and to the cults of the Failed in Absalom. The next time you would die from damage within 8 hours after you drink the ambrosia, it prevents you from [dying](conditions.md#Dying), you regain 20 Hit Points, the elixir's benefits end, and you become temporarily immune to the ambrosia of undying hope for 24 hours.

The ambrosia can't protect you from [death](death.md) effects or disintegration, but it can protect against almost any other form of death via damage. You can only be under the effect of a single ambrosia of undying hope at a time.
