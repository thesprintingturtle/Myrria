A favored weapon of dwarf scouts from Dongun Hold, the dwarven scattergun is a powerful weapon designed to take advantage of a dwarf's sturdy frame. A dwarven scattergun fires a large paper cartridge stuffed with black powder and knuckle-sized lumps of metal, creating a devastating burst so destructive that a foolish dwarf might find themself catching painful ricochets when firing at a too-close target. Some scatterguns are crafted with a clockwork firing tray that can quickly sort and load black powder and shot without needing a prepackaged cartridge, though this is largely an aesthetic feature with no real mechanical benefit.
