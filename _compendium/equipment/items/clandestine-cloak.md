When you pull up the hood of this nondescript gray cloak (an [Interact](interact.md) action), you become drab and uninteresting, gaining a +1 item bonus to [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) checks and to [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Impersonate](impersonate.md) a forgettable background character, such as a servant, but also taking a â€“1 item penalty to [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) and [Intimidation](../../skills.md#Intimidation) checks.

You pull the cloak's hood up and gain the benefits of nondetection for 1 hour or until you pull the hood back down, whichever comes first.
