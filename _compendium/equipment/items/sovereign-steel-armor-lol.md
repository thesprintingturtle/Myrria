[rare](rare.md)  

- **Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor
- **Category** Armor

Sovereign steel armor sickens certain creatures that touch it. A creature with weakness to cold iron that critically fails an unarmed attack against a creature in sovereign steel armor becomes [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened), and such a creature is [sickened](conditions.md#Sickened) as long as it wears sovereign steel armor. The noqual in sovereign steel armor provides protection against magic, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC against spell attack rolls. If you [Cast a Spell](cast-a-spell.md) while wearing sovereign steel armor, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the spell fails.
