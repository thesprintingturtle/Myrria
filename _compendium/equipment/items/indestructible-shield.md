An indestructible shield is a high-grade adamantine shield (Hardness 13, HP 90) that can withstand just about any damage. It can be damaged only by a [disintegrate](../../spells/disintegrate.md) spell (roll damage as if against a creature that failed its save) or by an artifact tied to destruction, such as a sphere of annihilation.
