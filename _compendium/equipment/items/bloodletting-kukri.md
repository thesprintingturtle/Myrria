This +1 striking kukri has a crimson blade that shimmers eerily in bright light. On a critical hit, the kukri deals `1d8` [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage). If the target didn't already have [persistent bleed damage](conditions.md#Persistent%20Damage) when you scored the critical hit, you also gain `1d8` temporary Hit Points.
