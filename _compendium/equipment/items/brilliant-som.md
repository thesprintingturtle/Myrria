# Brilliant *Item 12+*  
[evocation](evocation.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Usage** etched onto a weapon
- **Category** Rune

This rune causes a weapon to transform into pure, brilliant energy. The weapon deals an additional `1d4` fire damage on a successful [Strike](strike.md), as well as `1d4` good damage to fiends and `1d4` positive damage to undead.

On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or be [blinded](conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 round.

[light](../../../rules/traits/light.md)  

You plunge your weapon into darkness to return the light. Attempt a counteract check with a counteract level of 5 and a +19 counteract modifier to end a magical [darkness](../../../rules/traits/darkness.md) effect whose area is within reach of the weapon.
