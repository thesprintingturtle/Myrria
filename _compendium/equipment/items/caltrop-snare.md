# Caltrop Snare *Item 1*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [mechanical](mechanical.md)  [snare](snare.md)  [trap](trap.md)  

- **Price** 3 gp
- **Category** Snare

This snare consists of a [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) canister of [caltrops](caltrops.md) attached to a trip wire. When the snare is triggered, it flings the caltrops into either the snare's square or a square adjacent to the snare. You choose which square when you set up the snare.

If the [caltrops](caltrops.md) scatter into the same square as a creature, that creature must attempt the [Acrobatics](../../skills.md#Acrobatics) check immediately.
