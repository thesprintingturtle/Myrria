title: Activate [‚è≤](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Duration or Frequency")

- **Requirements**: You are standing on at least 5 feet of earthen material (such as stone, soil, clay, or sand)

**Effect** You sink into the ground and emerge at another location within 100 miles. This location must have an earthen surface at least 5 feet deep and you must be able to identify the location precisely by both its position relative to your starting position and its appearance or other identifying features. You can't carry extradimensional spaces with you to the destination, and if you attempt to do so, the activation fails.
