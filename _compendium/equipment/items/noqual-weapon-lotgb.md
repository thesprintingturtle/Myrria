# Noqual Weapon *Item 12+*  
[rare](rare.md)  

- **Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon
- **Category** Weapon

Noqual weapons are inimical to summoned creatures and spell effects that can be damaged by conventional attacks.

Against such targets, a [Strike](strike.md) with a noqual weapon gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to twice the number of weapon damage dice. In addition, noqual weapons disrupt spellcasters' concentration, causing them to become [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) for 1 round on a critical hit.
