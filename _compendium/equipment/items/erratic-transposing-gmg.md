# Erratic Transposing *Item 11*  
[conjuration](conjuration.md)  [cursed](cursed-gmg.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [rare](rare.md)  

- **Usage** curses a weapon
- **Category** Curse

This curse bursts with uncontrolled teleportation magic when activated, unreliably transporting creatures across the battlefield. On a critical hit with the affected weapon, you and an ally within 60 feet (chosen randomly) teleport to switch places with one another. If either of the affected creatures is unable to entirely fit within its new space, the creature is placed in the nearest available squares instead.
