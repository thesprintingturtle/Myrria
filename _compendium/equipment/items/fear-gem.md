Dark smoke seems to writhe within this obsidian gem. When you activate the gem, you make an [Intimidating Strike](../../feats/intimidating-strike.md), as the fighter feat.

If you have the [Intimidating Strike](../../feats/intimidating-strike.md) feat, increase the [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition value from this Intimidating [Strike](strike.md) to [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened), or [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) on a critical hit.
