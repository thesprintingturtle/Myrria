```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You activate the horn by blowing deeply into it, causing it to issue forth a low blast and cast a 2nd-level [obscuring mist](../../../compendium/spells/obscuring-mist.md) spell. You can [Dismiss](../../../rules/actions/dismiss.md) the mist at any time by blowing a second note on the horn using an [Interact](../../../rules/actions/interact.md) action.
```
