This kit of bandages, herbs, and suturing tools is necessary for [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine) checks to [Administer First Aid](administer-first-aid.md), [Treat Disease](treat-disease.md), [Treat Poison](treat-poison.md), or [Treat Wounds](treat-wounds.md). If you wear your healer's tools, you can draw and replace them as part of the action that uses them.
