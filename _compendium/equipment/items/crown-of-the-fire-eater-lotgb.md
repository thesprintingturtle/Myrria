- **Trigger**: You take fire damage

**Effect** You absorb some of the flame that would harm you. Increase your fire resistance from the crown from 5 to 15. Just after taking any remaining fire damage, you regain a number of Hit Points equal to 15 or the fire damage dealt by the triggering attack before damage resistance, whichever is less.
