A large, stylized symbol of an eye adorns the top of this wooden staff, representing the watchful eye of the divine powers. The bearer of the staff can guide and protect, seeing bounties and tragedies that could befall them in the future. When wielding this staff, you gain a +1 item bonus on [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) checks to [Sense Direction](sense-direction.md) or [Subsist](subsist.md), and to [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion) checks to [Recall Knowledge](recall-knowledge.md).

You expend a number of charges from the staff to cast a spell from its list.
