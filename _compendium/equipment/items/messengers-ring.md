# Messenger's Ring *Item 9+*  
[enchantment](enchantment.md)  [invested](invested.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Usage** worn
- **Category** Worn

This silver signet ring changes to match the insignia of a lord or organization you serve (or your own face, if you serve no one else). It grants you a +2 item bonus to [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) checks and lets you cast [message](../../spells/message.md) as an arcane innate spell at will.

The ring casts animal messenger to your specification. The animal is a magical creature that springs from the ring, and its appearance suits the iconography or heraldry of the lord or organization represented by the ring.
