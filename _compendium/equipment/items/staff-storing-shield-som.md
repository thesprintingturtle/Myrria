This magically reinforced [wooden shield](wooden-shield.md) normally has a blank face. It can absorb a staff and transform between a shield and staff. When you prepare a staff, you can hold it up to the shield, at which point the items will merge, and the shield's face becomes an image corresponding to the type of magic, such as a skull for a staff of necromancy.

You change the staff-storing shield from its shield form into the stored staff, which has an image of the shield on it, or change it from the stored staff back into a shield.
