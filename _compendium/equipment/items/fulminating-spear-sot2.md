This +1 striking returning spear is warm to the touch. The head of the spear is crafted from gold with ivory inlay and has a ruby set into the shaft. You can make the spear glow like a torch or suppress its light by using an action, which has the [concentrate](concentrate.md) trait.

You touch the ruby and hurl the spear at a square within 40 feet. When the spear lands, it detonates, dealing `6d6` fire damage (DC 23 basic Reflex save) to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation. It then flies back to your hand.
