# Invisible Chain Shirt *Item 13*  
[evocation](evocation.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Price** 2750 gp
- **Usage** worn armor
- **Category** Armor

This +2 resilient invisibility chain shirt is itself [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible). Other creatures can't see it at all, allowing you to wear it surreptitiously. Additionally, the armor's [invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) composition is quieter and more comfortable than a normal chain shirt.

It loses the [noisy](noisy.md) trait and gains the [comfort](comfort.md) trait.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You [Stride](../../../rules/actions/stride.md) and turn partially [invisible](../../../rules/conditions.md#Invisible), becoming [concealed](../../../rules/conditions.md#Concealed) until the end of your next turn or until you use a [hostile](../../../rules/conditions.md#Hostile) action, whichever comes first. As normal, you can use the concealment from this activation to [Hide](../../../rules/actions/hide.md).
```
