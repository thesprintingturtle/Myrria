A bi-resonant wayfinder is inlaid with intricate platinum wires in a complex array of conduits for magical energy. These conduits control the resonant interference of aeon stones. A bi-resonant wayfinder works just like a regular [wayfinder](wayfinder.md) except it has two aeon stone slots, and the aeon stones in both slots grant their resonant powers without interfering with each other. The bi-resonant wayfinder and the two aeon stones count as two items toward your investiture limit.
