This long metal pole has a large [chakram](chakram-lotgb.md) attached at the end. A mechanism within the handle allows the wielder to launch and retract the [chakram](chakram-lotgb.md), which is connected with wire to the inside of the weapon. The donchak is seldom seen used outside training scenarios.
