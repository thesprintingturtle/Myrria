# Anarchic *Item 11*  
[chaotic](chaotic.md)  [evocation](evocation.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Price** 1400 gp
- **Usage** etched onto a weapon without an axiomatic rune
- **Category** Rune

An anarchic rune is jagged and asymmetrical, channeling chaotic energy. A weapon with this rune deals an additional `1d6` chaotic damage against lawful targets. If you are lawful, you are [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) while carrying or wielding this weapon.

When you critically succeed at a [Strike](strike.md) with this weapon against a lawful creature, roll `1d6`. On a 1 or 2, you deal double minimum damage; on a 3 or 4, double your damage normally; on a 5 or 6, you deal double maximum damage.
