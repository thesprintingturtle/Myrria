# Mummified Bat *Item 10*  
[consumable](consumable.md)  [divination](divination.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [talisman](talisman.md)  

- **Price** 175 gp
- **Usage** affixed to a weapon
- **Activate** command; **Requirements** You are a master in [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception).
- **Category** Talisman

This talisman is the magically treated corpse of a tiny bat bound in papyrus. When you activate the bat, the affixed weapon detects vibrations around you and guides your perception. You gain the benefits of the fighter Blind-Fight class feat (page 149) for 1 minute.

If you have the Blind-Fight feat, you gain imprecise echolocation with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. This makes creatures that would be [undetected](conditions.md#Undetected) by you because you can't see them [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) instead.
