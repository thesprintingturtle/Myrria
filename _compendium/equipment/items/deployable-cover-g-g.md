# Deployable Cover *Item 1+*  
[uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

This thick mat of canvas, foliage, and wood is mounted on a tripod of flexible metal struts, folded into a batonlike shape, and clamped shut. You can rapidly deploy it on the ground with an [Interact](interact.md) action to create cover. Deployable cover is large enough to [Take Cover](take-cover.md) behind, allowing you (and others) to gain standard cover when you use the [Take Cover](take-cover.md) action. Before it can be used again, deployable cover must be carefully folded and clamped shut, which takes 1 minute.
