This elixir sharpens your mind and allows you to see through lies, falsehoods, and magical trickery.

You gain an item bonus to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks and [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) DCs to notice falsehoods, whether they're spoken lies or written deceit. You gain this same item bonus to Will saves.
