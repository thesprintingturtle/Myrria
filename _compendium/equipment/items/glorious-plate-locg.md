This elegant full plate is embossed with heraldic imagery and never tarnishes or loses its shine. Glorious plate is +2 resilient full plate. In battle, glorious plate sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius, which enemies see as a blinding halo that obscures creatures other than the wearer. When an enemy looks at the wearer, it must attempt a DC 33 Will saving throw. The enemy is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.

> [!success-degree] 
> - **Success** The enemy is unaffected.
> - **Failure** For 1 minute, the wearer's allies within the glorious plate's 10-foot radius of light are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) to the enemy. Allies are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) only while they remain within the light; if allies enter the light later, they are [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed) as well.
> - **Critical Failure** As failure, except the wearer's allies are [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) to the enemy instead of [concealed](conditions.md#Concealed). Activate [>>](chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action") command, [Interact](interact.md); Frequency once per 10 minutes; Effect The armor casts sanctuary on you.
