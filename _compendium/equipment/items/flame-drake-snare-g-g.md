The snare takes the form of a Tiny, drake-like clockwork toy. When a creature enters its square the snare activates, causing the drake to spit a gout of fire in a 15-foot cone in the direction from which the creature entered.

For instance, if a creature entered the square coming from the east, the cone would point east, to hit any allies behind the triggering creature. Those within the cone must succeed a DC 19 basic Reflex save or take `6d6` fire damage. After spitting its fire, the snare falls apart.
