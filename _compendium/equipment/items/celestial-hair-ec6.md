This strand of hair shimmers like the strands of fate. When you activate the string, it resonates with a single, perfect note. The triggering saving throw becomes a failure or the triggering attack roll becomes a regular hit, not critical one. If the source of the attack or effect is an evil creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 41 Will saving throw or be [enfeebled](conditions.md#Enfeebled) and [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) until the end of its next turn.
