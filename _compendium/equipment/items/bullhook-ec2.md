# Bullhook *Item 3+*  
[enchantment](enchantment.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

A bullhook is a stout rod about 4 feet long with a blunt hook on the end. Too dull to be useful as a weapon, a bullhook is instead used to direct animals in training or in performing their tasks. A bullhook grants you an item bonus to [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature) checks to [Command an Animal](command-an-animal.md) while you are holding it.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Two-Action")

You wave the bullhook to produce the effects of a [command](../../../compendium/spells/command.md) spell. This spell loses the [linguistic](../../../rules/traits/linguistic.md) trait and can target only animals.
