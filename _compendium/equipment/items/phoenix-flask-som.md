Once you ingest this strongly spiced, glowing red potion, blazing wings of a phoenix sprout from your back and carry you through the air.

For 1 minute, you gain a [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) speed of 40 feet.

The first time each round that you [Fly](rules/actions/fly.md) (including to hover in place), you shed burning feathers that deal `3d4` fire damage to all creatures in a 10-foot emanation at the end of your movement (DC 29 basic Reflex save).
