This liquid contains blood from a certain type of dragon. For 1 hour after you imbibe the concoction, you can unleash a breath weapon used by that type of dragon. The potency of the breath depends on the potion's type, based on the age of the dragon whose blood was used to make the potion.

This potion has the trait matching the damage type of the breath weapon.

Exhaling dragon breath uses a single action. The damage type and the area of the dragon breath depend on the type of dragon blood in the potion, as shown in the table below.

Regardless of the dragon type, the breath weapon deals `4d6` damage, and each creature in the area must attempt a DC 23 basic save of a type determined by the type of the dragon.

After you use the breath weapon, you can't do so again for `1d4` rounds.
