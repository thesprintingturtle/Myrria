# Timeless Salts *Item 4*  
[alchemical](alchemical.md)  [consumable](consumable.md)  

- **Price** 14 gp
- **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L
- **Activate** [Interact](interact.md)
- **Category** Consumable

You sprinkle these salts onto a single object up to 10 cubic feet in volume and no more than 40 Bulk to preserve it for 1 week.

The object doesn't decay, and effects that require the object to be fresh don't count the time passing during this duration as having elapsed. When sprinkled on a corpse, this extends the period in which a creature can be revived by magic, as well as the wait time required before a corpse can be targeted again with [talking corpse](../../spells/talking-corpse.md). The salts prevent ordinary pests from consuming the target (such as maggots for a corpse or moths for a piece of clothing). Any creature can use an [Interact](interact.md) action to disperse the salts from an unattended object and end this effect.
