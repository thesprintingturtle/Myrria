These small brooches usually feature carved reliefs of verminous, swarming creatures. When you wear the clasp, you gain resistance 10 to physical damage from swarm creatures.

You thrust your hand into the swarm, draw forth a squirming mass of vermin, and devour it. You recover `3d10+8` Hit Points and deal the same amount of bludgeoning damage to the swarm. The Hit Point recovery is a positive [healing](../../../rules/traits/healing.md) effect.
