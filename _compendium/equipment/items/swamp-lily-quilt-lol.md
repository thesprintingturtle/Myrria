This quilt is defined by its green lily-pad pattern, which is rare in Bellflower communications. The quilt is 10 feet square and infused with a reagent that activates when the quilt is laid out across soil or earth. One round after you lay out the quilt, the ground beneath it becomes soft and muddy, creating difficult terrain in the area where the quilt was. You can leave the quilt to maintain the difficult terrain indefinitely, but the affected ground begins to dry once you remove the quilt with an [Interact](interact.md) action. The ground dries over the span of 1 hour, after which the ground returns to normal terrain.

Placing the quilt on the ground uses up its infused reagents, and it becomes an ordinary quilt once removed from the ground.
