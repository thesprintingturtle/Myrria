You affix a trip line or other trigger to a group of either stones or wooden stakes to strike a creature that enters the snare's square. The creature must attempt a DC 26 basic Reflex saving throw. If you choose stones, the snare deals `9d8` bludgeoning damage; if you choose spikes, it deals `9d8` piercing damage.
