This ink, derived from inks used by lovers to deliver secret messages, dries to a color similar to most parchments. Avarneus's version requires another dose of lover's ink and a specific agitation to reveal the [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden) message, preventing casual interception. Any message written with lovers' ink is revealed by applying a page worth of lover's ink and vigorously shaking, requiring 3 [Interact](interact.md) actions. A typical vial provides enough ink to fill 1 page worth of text. While the text is [hidden](conditions.md#Hidden), a creature closely examining a surface marked with lover's ink can detect the presence of the ink with a successful DC 25 [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) check. On a critical success, they can make out the ink well enough to use [Society](../../skills.md#Society) to [Decipher Writing](decipher-writing.md).
