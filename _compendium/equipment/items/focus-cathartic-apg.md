Focus briefly calms your neurons, helping ease [mental](mental.md) effects.

When you drink this elixir, the elixir attempts a counteract check with the listed counteract modifier to remove the [confused](conditions.md#Confused) or [stupefied](conditions.md#Stupefied) condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract level and DC.
