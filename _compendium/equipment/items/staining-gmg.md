# Staining *Item 1*

- **Usage** curses gear or a weapon
- **Category** Curse

This property is associated with a specific color, which is defined at the time of the curse's creation. Whenever you use the affected equipment while taking a [manipulate](manipulate.md) action with another object, the second object is permanently stained the associated color. For instance, if you used a set of yellow _staining lockpicks_ to open a door, the lock would permanently become yellow. This color change does not otherwise unnaturally persist and can be changed via any normal mundane or magical means.
