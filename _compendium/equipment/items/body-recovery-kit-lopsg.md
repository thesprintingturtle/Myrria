This small silver tin is filled with a herb-infused salve and a shroud of fine silk fabric.

The salve smells of lavender and hyssop and is waxy to the touch. The shroud, made of spun silk, can a hold a Medium or smaller creature. If you apply the salve and shroud to a creature that died within the past 3 days, a process which normally takes 1 hour, it slows the decomposition process, allowing a creature to be brought back to life with raise dead up to 1 week after its death.
