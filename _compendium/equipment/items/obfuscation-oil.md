# Obfuscation Oil *Item 15*

You can spread this blue-gray gel on a single item with a Bulk of 3 or less to ward it against magical detection. It becomes immune to divination magic of 8th level or lower (such as locate). This oil is permanent, but it can be removed with acid.

Removing the oil in this way usually takes 1 minute for objects with Bulk of 1 or less, or a number of minutes equal to the item's Bulk.
