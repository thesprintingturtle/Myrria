You gain inner serenity, focused on fine details and steeled against mental assaults, but you find violence off-putting.

**Benefit** You gain an item bonus to Will saves and [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception), [Medicine](../../skills.md#Medicine), [Nature](../../skills.md#Nature), [Religion](../../skills.md#Religion), and [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) checks. This bonus improves when you attempt Will saves against [mental](mental.md) effects.

**Drawback** You take a –1 penalty to attack rolls and save DCs of offensive spells, and a –1 penalty per damage die to all weapon, unarmed attack, and spell damage.
