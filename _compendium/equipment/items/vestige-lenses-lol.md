# Vestige Lenses *Item 3*  
[alchemical](alchemical.md)  [rare](rare.md)  

- **Price** 40 gp
- **Usage** worn eyepiece; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Worn

These simple lenses are alchemically treated to detect the faint smoke trail from a piece of specially formulated sandalwood incense. This incense has an odor undetectable by most people and a long burn time, making it perfect for discreetly tracking individuals. A stick of this incense costs 1 sp and can safely burn for up to 8 hours. While wearing the lenses, you see alchemical fumes in a distinct green tint, granting you a +1 item bonus to [Survival](../../skills.md#Survival) checks to [Track](track.md) a creature marked with the incense and to [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](seek.md) any alchemical vapors. If the smoke is fresh, [Tracking](track.md) via the incense's fumes might use a lower DC than normal for tracking a creature walking on firm surfaces.
