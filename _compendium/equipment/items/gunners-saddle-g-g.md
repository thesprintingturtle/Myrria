# Gunner's Saddle *Item 2*  
[uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 20 gp
- **Usage** worn saddle; **Bulk** 2
- **Category** Stabilizers

Developed by marauders from the Mana Wastes, this clockwork saddle comes with a retractable weapon mount that can be used as a tripod to stabilize a weapon with the kickback trait. Just like a normal tripod, you [Interact](interact.md) to deploy the tripod to stabilize the firearm, and then again to retract the tripod to move it. The saddle uses complex hydraulics to protect the steed from the firearm's recoil.
