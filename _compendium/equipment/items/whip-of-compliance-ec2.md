# Whip Of Compliance *Item 9*  
[enchantment](enchantment.md)  [magical](magical.md)  [uncommon](uncommon.md)  

- **Price** 3000 gp
- **Usage** held, 1 hand; **Bulk** 1
- **Category** Held

The handle of this braided leather +1 striking whip is made from the hairs of a variety of rare and mythical animals. When used against an animal, the whip of compliance can potentially force the target to follow your commands.

```ad-embed-ability
title: Activate [>](../../../rules/core-rulebook/chapter-9-playing-the-game.md#Actions "Single Action")

Until the end of your current turn, any animals you [Strike](../../../rules/actions/strike.md) with the whip must attempt a DC 25 Will save.

On a failed or critically failed saving throw, the whip casts a 4th-level [suggestion](../../../compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spell on the animal with a base duration of 1 round, and the spell loses the [linguistic](../../../rules/traits/linguistic.md) trait. The course of action must still fulfill suggestion's requirements. If you can cast spells, you can expend one of your spells of 4th level or higher as a part of activating the whip; if you do so, the suggestions this turn have their normal base duration.
