The creator of the original thunder helm tried and failed time and again to craft a reliable, helmet-mounted firearm that enabled hands-free gunplay, but even after resorting to magical enhancements, they were never quite able to realize their vision. The allure of the thunder helm continues to compel certain mindsets in the Mana Wastes, and these items continue to be crafted to this day.

A thunder helm appears as a cylindrical iron helmet adorned with a crown-like display of gun barrels extending out in all directions. A slit in the front allows for limited visibility, while sound is muffled by the inner lining. As long as a creature wears a thunder helm, it takes a â€“1 circumstance penalty to auditory and visual [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks but also gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against [auditory](auditory.md) and [visual](visual.md) effects.

The helm's gun barrels swivel and aim randomly, then conjure enough gunpowder and bullets to fire in all directions around you. Every creature within a 20-foot emanation takes `4d6` piercing damage (DC 19 basic Reflex save). When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to this damage, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or bludgeoning.
