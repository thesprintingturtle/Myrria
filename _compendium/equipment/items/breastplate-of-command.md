This +1 resilient breastplate is made from shining bronze overlaid with reinforcing golden panels in the shape of lion's heads. Wearing this breastplate grants you a commanding aura. You gain a +2 item bonus to [Diplomacy](../../skills.md#Diplomacy) checks, but you take a â€“2 item penalty to [Stealth](../../skills.md#Stealth) checks to [Hide](rules/actions/hide.md) and [Sneak](sneak.md) and [Deception](../../skills.md#Deception) checks to [Impersonate](impersonate.md).

You grant allies within 100 feet a +2 status bonus to saves against [fear](../../../rules/traits/fear.md) effects for 1 minute. When you activate this ability, each affected ally who's [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) reduces their [frightened](../../../rules/conditions.md#Frightened) value by 1.
