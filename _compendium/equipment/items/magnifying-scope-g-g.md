# Magnifying Scope *Item 3+*  
[divination](divination.md)  [magical](magical.md)  

- **Usage** attached <to firearm or crossbow (scope)>; **Bulk** L
- **Category** Scope

These scopes use magically enhanced lenses to extend the range of your weapon and help spot distant foes. The scope grants you a +1 item bonus to visual [Perception](../../skills.md#Perception) checks to [Seek](seek.md) creatures through the scope.

While gazing through the scope, you zoom in on your targets to make it easier to hit them at a distance. You increase the range increment of the weapon to which the scope is attached by 5 feet until the beginning of your next turn or until you're no longer wielding the weapon, whichever comes first.
